\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
We study how advertising content influences consumers' decisions.
 To this end, we create a simulated online bookstore that imitates a real
 online shopping experience.
 We then conduct a pre-registered and incentive-compatible experiment in
 which we randomly expose store visitors to display ads, randomizing both
 advertising exposures and content.
 We find that ad content plays a major role in shaping advertising effects.
 Ads that reveal a book's low price consistently increase demand for the
 advertised book relative to ads that do not reveal price.
 By contrast, ads that reveal the book's genre induce some consumers to
 search and buy the book but lead others to reject it without search.
 We show these polarized responses can increase or decrease the total number
 of searches and purchases of the advertised book depending on the share
 of consumers who favor the revealed genre.
 Our findings suggest that advertisers should carefully choose which product
 attributes to reveal in their ad copies.
 We also show that revealing product attributes in ads does not change the
 total amount of search.
 Taken together, our results suggest the primary role of ad content is to
 affect consumers' beliefs about the advertised book rather than to alter
 the perceived benefits from search.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: The first sentences of the abstract are all about ad content, so it
 sounded a bit strange that we suddenly started talking about ad ad exposures
 in the end.
 I experimented with these last few sentences and landed on a simplified
 version which only mentions ad content effects on total search.
 I think it's okay to highlight only ad content-related effects and discuss
 'exposure vs content' in more detail in the intro.
 Please let me know what you think!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: question on the last sentence.
 does this perceived benefits of searching come kind of out of nowhere?
 i feel like we don't really develop that idea much in the paper.
 and it's not clear to me that the second clause logically follows directly
 from the first.
 what if we just stop at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more informative ad content does not reduce the total amount of search
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the abstract? Then we can develop the implications of that fact in the
 paper itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: I think it's important that we finish the last sentence by hinting at
 an important implication.
 Sure, we are being a bit criptic here, but we later elaborate on this in
 detail in the paper.
 Otherwise the abstract would just end abruptly, and the reader would think
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ok so total search does not change, so what? why are you telling me this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: An alternative strategy would be to remove the last sentence completely
 (as in the last draft we submitted), in which case our abstract would only
 highlight the main theory-driven findings and not the secondary analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: Re-reading the abstract again, I am leaning towards keeping the last
 sentence to make the paper look more interesting.
 Well, you can almost think about abstract as an ad for our papar, right?
 :) If so, then maybe a good strategy is to signal that we have the whole
 array of interesting results without explaining them in too much detail.

: presenting the right information can engage the audience from the first
 curtain rise, while failing to do so may squander their attention.
 Accordingly, the success of a campaign may depend on which product attributes
 firms choose to spotlight in their ads.
 By advertising specific attributes, firms hope to entice consumers into
 considering their product more closely.
 Chevrolet and Ford, for instance, highlight horsepower, fuel efficiency,
 and durability in their truck ads, while Apple and Samsung emphasize the
 battery life, camera quality, and price of their smartphones.

 indeed play a crucial role in driving ad effects

Industry practitioners believe that advertising content plays a crucial
 role in driving ad campaign effectiveness.
 Accordingly, firms heavily invest in developing ad creatives for their
 campaigns, often partnering with ad agencies to optimize advertising content.
 However, what makes an ad effective is a difficult question to answer,
 partially because one can hardly discern which elements of the multi-dimensiona
l ad content make a difference in practice.
 Nevertheless, a substantial body of academic research has attempted to
 understand which elements of ad creatives predict advertising effects,
 ranging from the aesthetics (color, music, etc.) to the informative content
 that characterizes advertised products.
 For example, the prior literature studied whether ads perform better when
 they induce rational or emotional response, or when they contain humor

 they face several endogeneity concerns.
 These conserns arise because firms can target both ads and ad content at
 specific consumer segments and during specific time periods, so the ads
 consumers see will generally correlate with their tastes.

 the endogeneity of ad exposure, the issue of ad content endogeneity has

\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nevertheless, studying how advertising content shapes demand matters for
 several economic questions of interest.
 First, without understanding how consumers respond to advertising content,
 it is difficult to assess whether ads help consumers make more informed
 choices.
 For example, firms may engage in advertising that does not reveal any product
 information, which simply diverts consumers' attention and draws them away
 from competitors.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: this works very well!
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Such advertising might be socially wasteful and lead to an equilibrium
 where consumers pay higher prices.
 The same might be true if advertisements do contain product information,
 but inattentive consumers ignore it and simply take ads as a prompt to
 examine the advertised alternative.
 In contrast, advertisements with informative content might inform consumers
 about product attributes, thus generating social benefit by improving the
 matching of consumers and products.
 Ads can also convey price information, making consumers more price sensitive
 and eventually leading to lower equilibrium prices.
 To assess which of these views on advertising is more appropriate, we ought
 to first understand how consumers respond to advertisements with different
 content.
 These insights can also reveal the extent to which firms have incentives
 to include product information in ads in the first place.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Second, by studying how consumers respond to advertising content, we can
 assess the potential effects of regulatory restrictions on advertising.
 For example, if consumers rely on advertising content for price information,
 then imposing a ban on price advertisements might increase equilibrium
 prices and reduce consumer welfare 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "milyo1999effect"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, regulators may consider a total ban on advertising as a
 tool for reducing the consumption of socially undesirable goods, such as
 alcohol, cigarettes, or junk food 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "goldfarb2011advertising,qi2013impact,dubois2018effects,tuchman2019advertising"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Such a ban can make consumers considerably less informed if they previously
 used advertising as a source of information about prices or product attributes.
 To understand how worrisome this concern is, we need to understand what
 information consumers glean from advertisements and how it affects their
 choices.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Third, understanding content effects has practical implications for empirical
 work on demand estimation.
 Suppose a researcher wishes to estimate a demand model with advertising
 effects.
 The extant literature often assumes that advertising directly shifts consumers'
 utility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nevo2001measuring,hendel2006measuring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or that it shifts consideration without affecting utility

 estimate a demand model in which advertising can shift both utility and
 consideration.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, it is a priori unclear whether advertising should be modeled as
 shifting consumers' preferences, consideration, or other primitives such
 as beliefs about product quality.
 In theory, advertisements may generate drastically different effects on
 demand depending on their informational content.
 For example, ads that reveal horizontal product attributes might rotate
 the demand curve clockwise, price ads might rotate it counter-clockwise,
 and ads without informative content might generate a simple outward shift

 theoretical literature, then researchers need to explicitly consider the
 information content of ads when specifying demand models.

The multidimensionality of advertising content suggests that informational

 consumers' choices beyond the effects of ad exposure itself.

 they face several endogeneity concerns.
 These concerns arise because firms can target both ads and ad content at
 specific consumer segments and during specific time periods, meaning which
 ads consumers see may correlate with their baseline propensity to purchase.
 For example, firms may choose to advertise products' prices during the
 season of deep holiday discounts, or they may support product launches
 by targeting likely adopters with ads that showcase the unique features
 of new products.
 Although the empirical advertising literature routinely grapples with the
 endogeneity of ad exposures, it has devoted much less attention to the
 endogeneity of ad content arising from such strategic content choices.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nevertheless, studying how advertising content shapes demand matters for
 several economic questions of interest.
 First, without understanding how consumers respond to advertising content,
 it is difficult to assess whether ads help consumers make more informed
 choices.
 For example, firms may engage in advertising that does not reveal any product
 information, which simply diverts consumers' attention and draws them away
 from competitors.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: this works very well!
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Such advertising might be socially wasteful and lead to an equilibrium
 where consumers pay higher prices.
 The same might be true if advertisements do contain product information,
 but inattentive consumers ignore it and simply take ads as a prompt to
 examine the advertised alternative.
 In contrast, advertisements with informative content might inform consumers
 about product attributes, thus generating social benefit by improving the
 matching of consumers and products.
 Ads can also convey price information, making consumers more price sensitive
 and eventually leading to lower equilibrium prices.
 To assess which of these views on advertising is more appropriate, we ought
 to first understand how consumers respond to advertisements with different
 content.
 These insights can also reveal the extent to which firms have incentives
 to include product information in ads in the first place.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Second, by studying how consumers respond to advertising content, we can
 assess the potential effects of regulatory restrictions on advertising.
 For example, if consumers rely on advertising content for price information,
 then imposing a ban on price advertisements might increase equilibrium
 prices and reduce consumer welfare 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "milyo1999effect"

.
 Alternatively, regulators may consider a total ban on advertising as a
 tool for reducing the consumption of socially undesirable goods, such as
 alcohol, cigarettes, or junk food

LatexCommand citep
key "goldfarb2011advertising,qi2013impact,dubois2018effects,tuchman2019advertising"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Such a ban can make consumers considerably less informed if they previously
 used advertising as a source of information about prices or product attributes.
 To understand how worrisome this concern is, we need to understand what
 information consumers glean from advertisements and how it affects their
 choices.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Third, understanding content effects has practical implications for empirical
 work on demand estimation.
 Suppose a researcher wishes to estimate a demand model with advertising
 effects.
 The extant literature often assumes that advertising directly shifts consumers'
 utility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nevo2001measuring,hendel2006measuring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or that it shifts consideration without affecting utility

 estimate a demand model in which advertising can shift both utility and
 consideration.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, it is a priori unclear whether advertising should be modeled as
 shifting consumers' preferences, consideration, or other primitives such
 as beliefs about product quality.
 In theory, advertisements may generate drastically different effects on
 demand depending on their informational content.
 For example, ads that reveal horizontal product attributes might rotate
 the demand curve clockwise, price ads might rotate it counter-clockwise,
 and ads without informative content might generate a simple outward shift

 If consumers indeed respond to advertising content as predicted in the
 theoretical literature, then researchers need to explicitly consider the
 information content of ads when specifying demand models.

At a fundamental level, we?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Using a simple search model, we formulate hypotheses on how attribute ads
 should affect consumers' search and purchase decisions.
 In our experiment, attribute ads reveal either a book's low price – a vertical
 attribute that appeals to all consumers (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

price ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) – or genre – a horizontal attribute that indicates the book's match value
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The model predicts that revealing a low price should weakly induce all

\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: I'm finding the demand shift discussions about vertical attributes a
 bit tricky.
 Here I think it sounds like we're suggesting a shift of the demand curve
 by saying it increases demand among all consumers.
 But in other places we explicitly describe it as a rotation since advertising
 a high price can decrease demand while advertising a low price can increase
 demand.
 I think it's a rotation if the vertical attribute is price, but it would
 be a shift of the demand curve if the vertical attribute were something
 else, like

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Theory predicts a downstream consequence: if the firm starts to change
 its price, with price ads it will realize that the demand has rotated counter-c
lockwise.

We find our experimental results to be remarkably consistent with these
 theoretical predictions.
 Relative to plain ads, price ads increase searches and purchases of the
 advertised book regardless of consumers' genre preferences.
 Revealing price makes the ad, on average, 26% more effective at driving
 searches and 35% more effective at driving purchases.

 By contrast, genre ads induce polarized responses relative to plain ads:
 consumers who favor the revealed genre become more likely to search the
 book, while those who do not favor the genre discard the book without searching.

 Revealing attributes in ads also does not change the total number of books
 consumers search or the time they spend searching.
 Thus, in our setting, ad content primarily affects consumers' beliefs about
 the advertised book's attributes instead of changing attribute salience
 or altering the perceived benefits from searching.

 helps match consumers with products that are a good fit.

 Thus, our findings suggest that advertising content can generate social
 benefit by helping consumers find better-matching products.

How Do Restrictions on Advertising Affect Consumer Search?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Abstract: Advertising is often criticized for presenting only partial or
 selective information about products.
 This criticism is particularly pronounced for health products, where large
 asymmetries in information may exist between consumers and firms.
 This paper explores how government restrictions designed to prevent selective
 advertising affect the types of information to which consumers are exposed.
 We exploit a natural experiment in the form of a U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) crackdown that prevented pharmaceutical
 companies from using selectively chosen information in their Internet search
 ads.
 Because companies could not adequately document side effects within the
 advertising space allowed, they removed their ads.
 Our results suggest that, after the ads were removed, consumers were more
 likely to seek information from websites based on user-generated content
 or websites that focused on medical treatments not regulated by the FDA,
 such as Canadian pharmacies and sites promoting herbal remedies.

Second, by understanding how consumers respond to advertising content, we
 can assess the potential effects of regulatory restrictions on advertising.
 For example, our experiment results suggest that consumers may respond
 strongly to prices revealed in ads.
 If consumers in real-world markets also rely on advertising content for
 price information, then imposing a ban on price advertisements may increase
 equilibrium prices and reduce consumer welfare 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "milyo1999effect"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our experiment also shows that consumers may respond to advertisements
 that reveal horizontal attributes of books such as genre.
 This result suggests that consumers may use advertisements as a source
 of product attribute information.
 In this case, a total ban on advertising, such as those often used to reduce
 consumption of socially undesirable goods, can make consumers considerably
 less informed

 Therefore, if the book's genre is relatively niche, a publisher should
 either design a mass advertising campaign that uses uninformative content,
 or design a targeted campaign in which consumers who like the book's genre
 are targeted with content that informs them about a good match.

 In fact, maybe you could say firms ARE doing this - if the data in the

BRETT: The argument here and below seems to mostly relate to categories

 I agree with your statement that we "rarely see advertisements with informative
 content".

 A more definitive way to empirically demonstrate causal- ity is through
 controlled experimentation, such as A/B testing, as in Johnson, Lewis,

 Another alterna- tive for traditional media would be a natural experimentation,
 as in the advertising boundaries approach of Shapiro (2018).

 whose organic listing resides on page 
\begin_inset Formula $l(k)>1$

 title and cover image.
 We assume a plain ad moves the book into the consumer's default awareness
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

, reducing its discovery cost to zero.
 Because the ad does not reveal genre or price, the consumer needs to pay
 a search cost

 to reveal these attributes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Proposition 2a shows that the incremental effect of revealing the genre
 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

 differs across consumers depending on their genre preferences.
 Specifically, revealing genre polarizes consumers' search decisions.
 Consumers who like the revealed genre learn that the book is a good match
 and become more likely to search the book knowing that the costly inspection
 is justified.
 By contrast, consumers with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 who dislike the revealed genre conclude that book 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is a bad match not worth searching.
 Thus, revealing genre increases searches of the book among some consumers
 while reducing them among others.
 This effect on searches also translates into more polarized purchase decisions.
 In turn, Proposition 2b shows that the total effect of revealing genre
 on searches and purchases of the book will then depend on the exact distributio
n of genre tastes 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 across consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To gain intuition, suppose a publisher of the book

We hypothesize this polarization effect and test it in our experiment.
 Testing this effect is important because it has several implications.
 First, knowing whether content effects might be negative is crucial for
 managers trying to optimize ad content in their advertising campaigns.
 Second, the polarized responses of consumers can be viewed as a shift toward
 more efficient search.
 Advertising content can help some consumers locate books of their preferred
 genre while helping others avoid wasteful searches.
 To assess these implications, we need to empirically measure how consumers
 respond to genre ads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider an ad that reveals a vertical attribute – the book's price.
 As with genre ads, a price ad generates the same exposure effects as a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: I had a never-ending conversation with Kwabena about this - he wouldn't
 let go of the fact that price is not vertical since it could itself be
 a signal of quality and some people might not want something cheap if they
 think its low quality.
 To avoid confusion and at least assert our perspective, I propose the edit
 above that retains the second half of the sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: I also had this very same conversation to him, but I find this to be
 a niche opinion.
 I think it's going to be clear to the average reader that low price is
 good news, and that our assumption alpha>0 looks reasonable to the first
 approximation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: Kwabena's theory does not make any difference unless the majority of
 consumers consider price as a signal, which seems implausible.
 If this were the case, researchers would routinely find positive price
 elasticities in demand estimation, which does not happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
IM: I am okay with your version, but I think we lose some information because
 we no longer derive this idea from our assumption that :

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Previous version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because all consumers have the same price coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>0$
\end_inset

, the revealed price information will unambiguously be considered goods
 news by all consumers.
 Having learned that the book is cheaper than they expected, consumers will
 then be more likely to search the book: although they still do not know
 some of its attributes, this book now looks more appealing than before
 they saw the ad.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and thus become more likely to search the book.
 Although they still do not know this book's other attributes, the book
 now looks more appealing than it did before they saw the ad (Proposition
 3a).
 This positive effect on search translates into additional purchases, thus
 increasing the average purchase probability of the advertised book relative
 to that under the plain ad (Proposition 3b).

When choosing which books to advertise, we select books for which demand
 is likely to respond to advertising.
 Advertising an unappealing book would have little effect on choices, which
 would not give us sufficient power to precisely measure ad content effects.
 To avoid this issue, we select the mystery book 
\shape italic
Stateline
\shape default
 by Dave Stanton and the romance novel 
\shape italic
The Lost Girls of Ireland
\shape default
 (henceforth 
\emph on
Lost Girls) 
\emph default
by Susanne O'Leary.
 Both books are relatively popular within their genre subcategories on Amazon
 (e.g., customer ratings 4.2 and 4.3 out of 5 on Amazon).
 To enhance the appeal of these books, we reduce their prices from the original
 $2.99 on Amazon to $0.99, thus making them among the cheapest books in our
 store.
 We also choose these books because they have nondescript titles and covers
 that do not obviously reveal the book's genre, which helps us isolate the
 incremental effect of revealing genre in the ads.
 We place both books on the second page of the default product list to ensure
 we are not advertising options that are already salient.
 This placement also matches our theoretical setting in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:theory"

We made the experiment incentive-compatible by fulfilling participants'
 orders.
 We gave each participant a budget of $3, which is sufficient to purchase
 any book in the store.
 We told participants that we would conduct a lottery that gives each participan

 In addition to their baseline compensation of $1.50, participants who won
 the lottery received their selected e-book and the remainder of their $3
 budget as a cash bonus.
 Participants who did not win received only the baseline compensation of
 $1.50.
 Conducting a lottery helped us reduce the expected experiment cost while
 still incentivizing participants to select books they truly like.

I kind of wish we had a clean way of connecting our results back to Propositions

 testing those propositions.

as long as

 conditions - as long as the share is large enough or as long as the price
 is low enough.
 Are these propositions really testable? Our empirical analysis gets at
 what's happening under the hood of these propositions - ie polarization
 underlying the genre ads - but its not really a test.
 To test Prop 3, wouldn't we really want ads with high prices and show that
 those ads dont increase search and purch relative to plain ads?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RE genre ads: I feel like Prop 2 is about a net effect (increase or decrease
 in aggregate) whereas polarization is about variance.
 These are related but also feel somewhat distinct to me.
 Would it make sense to have Proposition 2A and 2B and 3A and 3B - one would
 talk about the distributional changes and the other would talk about the
 net effect?

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Matching with GA leaves us with 13,201 mturkers in temp/qualtrics.dta (this

 of the participants either used ad blockers or privacy-enhancing browsers
 that made it impossible for us to track their actions.
 We exclude these participants from the sample.
 Because participants are unlikely to change their browser privacy settings
 in response to seeing ads in our bookstore, we assume that this selection
 criterion is orthogonal to the experimental assignment.
 We further tested whether there was differential attrition across experimental
 conditions but found no evidence of such imbalances (joint

 First, we show that consumers engage in meaningful search: the average
 consumer spends 3.7 minutes in the store, opens 4.0 product list pages, and
 searches 1.9 unique books (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 genre preferences (see Figure

Having validated our experimental data, we use them to estimate how consumers
 respond to ad exposure and ad content.
 In all analyses, we estimate ad effects using a linear regression model

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$

Our model rests on the assumption that consumers cannot infer genre from
 the book's title and cover art, and thus the genre ad reveals new information
 relative to the plain ad.
 To test whether this assumption holds, we look for evidence of differential
 search patterns in the plain ads condition.
 If consumers exposed to a plain ad can infer the advertised book's genre,
 then those who favor that genre should search the book more frequently
 than others.

In fact, if consumers can infer the book's genre from its cover, they will

 they favor the advertised genre.

 Is our logic somewhat flawed here? Someone who likes romance novels will
 actively seek romance novels during search, so even without ads, the search

AT: Hmm, OK I see what you're saying RE the no ads condition.
 What helped me was to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suppose the books were completely neutral up front, like black images with
 BOOK 1, 2, 3...
 on them, people who like mysteries would still be more likely to have searched
 Stateline because they would continue searching until finding a mystery
 novel, whereas people who like romance would be more likely to have stopped
 search before getting to Stateline.
 Given the size of our assortment, wouldn't those differences be really
 tiny if the cover art is 100% neutral? Now I'm trying to think through
 the treatment effect of a plain ad with this completely neutral cover.
 Everyone has pretty high odds of clicking on it.
 But is it clear that the treatment effect of the plain ad should be equal
 for people who like and dislike mysteries even with this completely neutral
 cover? Didn't we find previously that ad effects are actually lower for
 people who like the genre because they were already finding it? And that
 was with potentially informative covers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ultimately, this all seems pretty complicated.
 Here's how I think about it.
 Because people who like romance are less likely to search Lost Girls in
 the plain ads condition relative to people who dont like romance, we can
 conclusively say the title and cover aren't helping people realize its
 a good match.
 For Stateline, it's possible the title and cover art are conveying that,
 but this higher search by people who like the genre could also just be
 driven by their natural search path even with uninformative titles and
 covers.
 Maybe we just leave our analysis as-is and add a footnote about that previous
 sentence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 assumptions (e.g., that absent ads the differences in click rates will be

 However, after exposure to a plain ad for

We formally test these effects in Table

\end_inset

 by estimating the ATE of genre ads on search and purchase probabilities
 relative to plain ads.
 To maximize statistical power, we pool consumers into two groups: those
 who ranked the advertised book's genre as their most preferred genre and
 everyone else.
 Panels A and B present results separately for each book, and in Panel C
 we pool data from both books.
 Focusing on the pooled estimates, we find that revealing genre significantly
 increases the search probability of the advertised book for consumers who
 favor its genre by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.050/0.139\approx36\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.005$
\end_inset

) and significantly decreases it by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.024/0.118\approx20\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.003$
\end_inset

) for all other consumers.
 We also show suggestive evidence that these effects translate into purchases:
 revealing genre increases the advertised book's purchase rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.024/0.092\approx26\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.104$
\end_inset

) for consumers who favor the advertised genre and decreases the purchase
 rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.007/0.063\approx11\%$

 As Proposition 2b shows, because revealing genre polarizes consumers' responses
, the overall effectiveness of a genre ad depends on the share of consumers
 who favor the advertised genre.
 In our sample, consumers rank the mystery genre much higher on average
 than the romance genre (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hist_genre_preferences"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For this reason, revealing the genre of a mystery book generates strong
 positive effects on searches that offset the negative effects on consumers
 who dislike the genre.
 By contrast, revealing the genre of a romance book generates mostly negative
 effects on search, which overpower the positive effects among the smaller
 group of consumers who like romance novels.

\begin_layout Standard
Next, to explain why price ads appear to be the most effective at driving
 searches and purchases, we turn to Proposition 3.
 Specifically, Proposition 3a posits that revealing price should increase
 the search and purchase probabilities of the advertised book for all consumers
 regardless of their genre preferences, assuming the revealed price is sufficien
tly appealing.
 The latter assumption holds in our experiment because price ads reveal
 the advertised book to be one of the cheapest options in the store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this prediction, in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:demand_rotations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b we visualize the average search rate of the advertised book under price
 ads (red dashed line) and plain ads (blue solid line) for the same five
 consumer groups based on their stated genre preferences.
 Relative to plain ads, price ads increase the search probabilities in all
 consumer groups.
 We analyze these differences formally in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:price_ads_by_genre"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Consistent with Proposition 3a, the price ad directionally increases the
 search rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.020/0.139\approx14\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.244$
\end_inset

) among consumers who ranked the advertised genre first and by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.017/0.118\approx14\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.059$
\end_inset

) among all other consumers.
 Once again, these effects on search translate into purchases: revealing
 price directionally increases purchases among consumers who rate the advertised
 genre first 
\begin_inset Formula $0.005/0.092\approx5\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.717$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $0.018/0.063\approx28\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.010$
\end_inset

) among all other consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These uniform responses explain why price ads are highly effective in our
 experiment.

\end_layout

 our theoretical model clarifies the mechanisms behind these content effects.
 When an ad reveals a favorable vertical attribute, such as a low price,
 the effects of ad content are positive across consumers with different
 genre preferences because all consumers positively update their beliefs
 about the book.

 By contrast, revealing a horizontal attribute, such as the book's genre,

 significantly reduces searches and directionally reduces purchases of the
 advertised book.

We have so far discussed how ad content influences searches and purchases

 In practice, advertising content effects might also spill over to non-advertise

 Although our search model does not directly predict these spillovers, the
 prior empirical literature has presented evidence that ad exposure increases
 demand for products that are similar to the advertised option

 If ads lift the entire category, then individual advertisers won't internalize
 the total effects of ads and will bid a lot less than the platform would
 like them to.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: Are you picturing this as sales neutral substitution from one subcategory
 to another? or expanding the size of the entire pie for the platform? If
 it's just substitution, then I think there would need to be more details
 to justify this, like its a higher margin subcategory etc.
 Maybe instead of talking about encouraging/subsidizing which seems to imply
 category expansion, we can just say a platform would want to understand
 the substitution patterns that could be generated? This could be relevant
 for knowing how much inventory to stock of different books?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 the entire category, and it's higher margin than what people usually buy,

, we test for spillover effects using several outcome variables.
 First, if a price ad induces consumers to search other inexpensive books,
 consumers may sort books by price to locate other cheap options.
 In the same vein, if a genre ad encourages consumers to seek other books
 of the same genre, they may use filters to navigate to the relevant genre
 subcategory.

 Second, even without inducing consumers to use different search tools,
 ad content could still make them more likely to click on the organic listings
 of similar books.
 We test for this effect but find little evidence that price ads increase
 the search or purchase probabilities of other inexpensive books priced
 below $1 (
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $0.599$

 We speculate that consumers examine the product list page from top to bottom
 and from left to right, which generates natural position effects.
 The ad banner then disrupts the normal flow of search and weakens these
 position effects.
 This may explain why the two books in the leftmost column become less popular
 – these books would normally be the most salient.
 The advertising banner might draw attention away from these books and toward
 books that are located near the banner itself.

 they could affect the quality of the consumer's final choice.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Ads could save consumers time by reducing the number of books they need
 to examine before finding a good match, or they could divert consumers'
 search toward a low quality option and increase the amount of time needed
 to find a good book.
 The welfare effects of ads will also depend on whether the books consumers
 choose after seeing ads match their preferences better or worse than the
 books they would choose without ads.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(Old version) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

An ad can make consumers better-off: it may reduce the number of books consumers
 need to examine before making a choice, thus saving time, and it may lead
 consumers to purchase a book of higher quality than they would have purchased
 absent ads.
 At the other extreme, an ad can make consumers worse-off by diverting their
 search toward a low-quality option, or even pushing them to make a choice
 they will later regret.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: Before we get into wordsmithing, maybe we can decide on the following:
 Do you think we need to work these effects into our model framework and
 propositions/conjectures section? While I think that empirically these
 effects could go either way, I worry that theory would point to only one
 direction, depending on the assumptions made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, take plain ads and lets suppose that all types of consumers
 are more likely to search that advertised book because of the ad.
 Then would theory predict that consumers that like the genre of the advertised
 option should decrease total search because they've already stumbled across
 a genre that roughly matches their tastes with higher probability than
 they would without the ad? But consumers that don't lke the advertisted
 genre should need to search more because they have now wasted a search
 on a book that doesn't match their tastes? And thus whether search goes
 up or down depends on the fraction of consumers with tastes that match
 the advertised genre?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Then I think the prediction for genre ads is that, in theory, consumers
 who liek the genre ad should see even more improvement in the efficiency
 of their search.
 Consumers who don't like the advertised genre might also see improvement
 in efficiency relative to plain ads because they now know NOT to waste
 a search on that book, so they don't make that mistake.
 Of course this is all the theory.
 These content effects don't seem to play out in practice (maybe because
 of limited power), though maybe one reason is we need to cut these effects
 by genre tastes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Understanding these effects might be of particular interest for platforms
 that want to know whether showing ads on their websites can improve the
 shopping experience and increase customer retention.

 we have in the text.

 Thus, although plain ads help consumers make their choices with less search,
 they do not necessarily improve the quality of these choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad content may amplify both of these effects.
 Genre ads, for instance, may help consumers quickly find a book with a
 high match value, reducing the time they need to spend on search.
 Our data do not support this conjecture: relative to plain ads, attribute
 ads do not generate incremental effects on the number of searched books,
 number of opened product list pages, shopping time, or the probability
 of keeping the book (see Appendix Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ads_and_total_search"

 These findings suggest that revealing product attributes in ad creatives
 does not save consumers time and does not change how satisfied consumers
 are with their final choices.

 noisy and that the decision of whether to keep the book after the study
 may not capture all facets of consumer satisfaction.

Low price brings people in, but ultimately they still make a decision under

At the same time, the effect on prices is ambiguous.
 On the one hand, advertising scares away low-valuation consumers and may
 therefore reduce overall demand, encouraging lower prices.

 face less elastic demand and might therefore afford to charge a higher
 price

Arbatskaya develops a model of ordered search that allows advertising to
 influence the order in which consumers examine alternatives.
 In her model, advertising moves the product to the top of the search queue,
 thus allowing the firm to charge a price premium (

Finally, our paper provides guidance for researchers seeking to estimate
 demand models that incorporate advertising effects.
 Our results suggest that, when modeling advertising effects, researchers
 may want to account for the advertising content.
 This need not require estimating a complex search model.
 For example, one can cast a sequential search model as a discrete choice
 model in which consumers choose the good with the highest index 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=\delta_{j}+\min(\varepsilon_{j}^{z},\varepsilon_{j})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the usual utility shock and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}^{z}$
\end_inset

 is a function that depends on the search cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer's belief about unobserved attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "armstrong2017ordered,choi2018consumer"

\end_inset

.
 In markets where ads do not reveal attributes, one can model ads as reducing
 the product's search cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

, which would capture the awareness effect.
 By contrast, in markets where ads reveal product information, it makes
 more sense to model ads as informing consumers about specific product attribute
s.
 The researcher can then derive 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}^{z}$
\end_inset

 by computing a consumer's updated beliefs after being exposed to an ad.

 However, it is a priori unclear whether advertising should be modeled as

 Using data from an incentive-compatible experiment, we estimate how ad
 content causally influences consumer search and choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although there are benefits to creating a simulated store, this approach
 is not without limitations.
 Relative to major online bookstores, our store lacks customer ratings and
 reviews, which could serve as an alternative source of information about
 products and thus reduce the effects of ad content.
 Further, our limited book assortment and forced-choice design could lead
 to larger than normal ad effects in our setting.
 For this reason, we caution against interpreting our results as capturing
 realistic magnitudes of ad effects in online retail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these limitations, we believe the methodology of creating a simulated
 online store holds promise.
 As our results show, it is possible to create a store where consumers make
 realistic search and purchase decisions and respond to ads.
 We have also demonstrated that one can conduct a large-scale lab experiment
 with thousands of participants by choosing a product that can be delivered
 online.

 Researchers can apply this methodology to other marketing problems, not
 necessarily related to ad content effects.
 Having created a simulated store, researchers can freely manipulate how
 the store presents information about products.
 Through such experiments, researchers could study how online retailers
 and platforms ought to optimally design the information environment in
 which consumers conduct their search.

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}>0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{G}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})<F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

, so the distribution of utilities under the genre ad first-order stochastically
 dominates that under the plain ad.
 Thus, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{G}>z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 for any price sensitivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},$
\end_inset

 and therefore the probabilities that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 searches and purchases book 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 both increase.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 then similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{G}(u|p;\gamma_{i})>F_{u}^{A}(u;\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{G}<z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 for any price sensitivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, so the search and purchase probabilities for book 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 decrease.
 Finally, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{G}=w_{ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 and the search and purchase probabilities of the consumer do not change.
 Combining these results, we get that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\bar{f}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{s,k}^{G}$

 Moreover, it also holds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\check{f}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 such that the effect is reversed if 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr(\gamma_{i}<0)>\check{f}$
\end_inset

 In that case, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{s,k}^{G}$

Unconditional search and purchase probabilities can be then obtained by
 integrating these individual responses over the distribution of genre tastes

 of the advertised book as long there is a substantial mass of consumers

Proof of Proposition 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the same arguments as in Proposition 2, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{A}=\min(u_{ik},z_{s,ik}^{A})$
\end_inset

 under the plain ad and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{P}=\min(u_{ik},z_{s,ik}^{P})$
\end_inset

 under the price ad.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because the search cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be the same in both cases, the difference between these search
 values is fully determined by the difference in the expected distribution
 of utilities.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The consumer expects the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{ik}$
\end_inset

 to be distributed with CDF 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})=Pr(-\alpha_{i}p_{j}+\gamma_{i}g_{j}+\varepsilon_{ik}<u)$
\end_inset

, under the plain ad and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{P}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})=Pr(-\alpha_{i}p+\gamma_{i}g_{j}+\varepsilon_{ik}<u|p=p_{j})$
\end_inset

 under the price ad.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}=p^{max}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{P}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})>F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 so the utility distribution under the plain ad stochastically dominates
 that under the price ad.
 This implies 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{P}<z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

, which leads to a lower probability of searching and purchasing book 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for any taste profile 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 In turn, if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{P}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})<F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,k}^{P}>z_{s,k}^{A}$

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, by connecting our WordPress account to Google Analytics, we collect
 anonymized individual-level data that capture everything website visitors
 see and do when browsing our bookstore.
 The default Google Analytics software tracks basic events like clicks and
 add-to-cart events, logging them with corresponding time stamps.
 We augment these data by creating custom event tags that document consumer
 search at a more granular level.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To further improve this methodology, researchers can employ state of the
 art tracking tools such as screen recordings and heat maps offered in commercia
l analytics software (e.g., Hotjar, Mouseflow, or Contentsquare).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 With these custom tags, we track how far down a person scrolls in the product
 list; the number of product list pages they open; whether they use filters,
 sorting tools, or search queries; whether they click on the advertising
 banner; and even whether they open several tabs in their browser while
 comparing books.
 We also observe the order in which books are presented to each user in
 the default sort, on product list pages after applying filters or using
 search queries, and in recommendation panels.
 To verify the quality of collected data, we browse the store according
 to a pre-determined script and verify that the resulting dataset accurately
 reflects the scripted browsing activity (see the Online Supplement for
 details).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We populate our bookstore with an assortment of 100 strategically selected
 books.
 We describe our book selection criteria below.
 Our store should offer a reasonably large assortment of differentiated
 options to create a meaningful search problem.
 To this end, we include books from five different genres: biography/memoir,
 fantasy, mystery/thriller, romance, and science fiction.
 By including books of different genres, we make sure the store offers appealing
 options for users with heterogeneous preferences.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: this seems kind of obvious
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While offering more than 100 books is technically feasible, doing so would
 increase the number of unique book titles we need to manually purchase
 on Amazon, thus making the fulfillment of orders time-consuming.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also want to select high-quality books to interest users in making a
 purchase and keeping the book after the study.
 However, we do not want any particular book to dominate other options.
 To achieve this balance, we scrape genre-specific bestseller lists from
 Amazon and construct a list of the 300 most popular books within each genre.
 For each genre, we then discard the top 50 and select 20 books that are
 currently sold at a price below $3, which helps us reduce the expected
 cost of the experiment.
 Choosing inexpensive books also reduces the dispersion of prices in the
 store, thus making it more likely that no single book dominates other options.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recruited participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
 In all studies, we used Cloud Research, a platform that facilitates the
 recruiting of MTurk workers for academic and industry research.
 First, to stress-test our experiment infrastructure, we ran a pilot experiment
 on February 1-3, 2022.
 This study was a simplified experiment with only 
\begin_inset Formula $N=692$
\end_inset

 participants and one advertising banner instead of six.
 Based on the results of this pilot experiment, we selected a compensation
 scheme that allows us to incentivize realistic choices while also minimizing
 the cost of the experiment (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:incentive_compatibility"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 Specifically, during the pilot experiment we randomly assigned all participants
 to four incentive conditions: 0% fulfillment (no one gets an e-book or
 a bonus), 10% lottery, 50% lottery, and 100% fulfillment (all participants
 receive an e-book and a bonus).
 We found that 50% is the lowest fulfillment probability that enables us
 to measure advertising effects similar to those in the fully incentivized
 100% fulfillment condition.
 Based on the results of this study, we fixed the lottery probability at
 50% in the main experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, between March 30, 2022, and April 23, 2022, we conducted a pre-test
 of our main experiment with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1,191$
\end_inset

 participants.
 The data from this pre-test were used to obtain preliminary estimates of
 advertising effects, which served as inputs into our power calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we pre-registered our main experiment on AsPredicted.org on May
 18, 2022, and we ran it between May 19, 2022, and August 3, 2022.
 Based on the pre-test data, we calculated that we would need at least 12,500
 participants to measure the effects of advertising exposure and content.
 Because our budget was fully determined by an external grant, we committed
 to running the study until we exhausted all available resources or ran
 out of participants to recruit on Amazon MTurk–whichever happened sooner
 (see the pre-registration document).
 In the end, we were able to collect survey responses from 
\begin_inset Formula $N=16,088$
\end_inset

 participants before we exhausted our budget, out of which 
\begin_inset Formula $N=11,498$
\end_inset

 participants (71.5%) had complete browsing and purchase data.

 To ensure they did not know the true purpose of the study, we did not mention
 advertising in the recruitment materials.
 We informed all participants that they must complete the survey using a
 standard browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
 Our goal was to minimize the number of participants who use privacy-focused
 browsers, such as Brave and Avast, which actively block user-tracking software.
 Importantly, before the study, we did not explicitly mention anything about
 behavior tracking to participants, as we did not want to alert them to
 the fact that their browsing behavior would be monitored.
 We also contemplated asking participants to turn off their ad blockers
 but decided against it for fear of artificially drawing attention to advertisem

Randomization Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:two_randomizations"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment randomizes participants into seven advertising conditions
 that determine which advertising banner the participant sees on the front
 page of the bookstore.
 We ran the main experiment between May 19, 2022, and August 3, 2022.
 During the first part of the experiment, between May 19, 2022, and July
 5, 2022, we implemented randomization in the bookstore by using a paid
 plug-in called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A/B Testing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for WooCommerce.
 The plug-in served random advertisements to all website visitors, assigning
 each user to one of the seven experimental conditions according to the
 pre-specified probabilities.
 The plug-in tracked individual users over time with cookies so that users
 would not be re-randomized into another condition when they returned to
 the front page.
 While this randomization method worked well and passed all our quality
 tests (see the Online Supplement for details regarding these tests), we
 later realized that this method has a drawback.
 Specifically, because participants who used ad blockers or privacy browsers
 were not generating any search data, we could not observe which experimental
 conditions they were assigned to.
 Moreover, we suspected that ad blockers were more active at blocking Google
 Analytics in the treatment arms than in the control group.
 While this issue did not seem to affect our randomization checks, we confirmed
 this suspicion by browsing the website while using different ad blockers
 and checking the data gathered by Google Analytics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this issue of missing data, we paused the experiment on July
 5 and re-designed our randomization algorithm.
 In particular, we removed the A/B testing plug-in from the bookstore and
 instead performed randomization in the Qualtrics survey before sending
 participants to the bookstore.
 Operationally, this randomization system worked as follows.
 At the start of the Qualtrics survey, we assigned each participant to one
 of the seven experimental conditions according to the same pre-specified
 probabilities as before.
 We then gave each user a seven-digit code, e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1BG83WL,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which the first symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reflects the experimental assignment and the remaining text 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

BG83WL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a unique combination of alphanumeric symbols drawn without replacement.
 The user was then instructed to use their seven-digit code in the bookstore,
 both at the entry gate and at checkout.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because we randomly generated 7-digit alphanumeric codes, it was difficult
 for participants to cheat by guessing another valid unique code and buying
 another book.
 Even if they managed to do so, we would detect fraud because both book
 orders would be registered from the same IP address, which we would observe
 in the Google Analytics dataset.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If-So
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plug-in for WooCommerce, we then served users their assigned advertisements
 based on the first digit of the seven-digit code they used at the entry
 gate.
 The advantage of this new randomization algorithm was that we knew users'
 experimental assignments even when they used ad blockers and privacy browsers
 because users were randomized before they visited the store.
 We resumed the study with this new randomization and ran it between July
 13, 2022, and August 3, 2022.
 We recruited about 60% of our total sample of participants under the first
 randomization algorithm and the remaining 40% under the second algorithm.

As detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we conducted a lottery in which each participant had a 50% chance of having
 their order fulfilled, which meant receiving their selected book as well
 as a monetary bonus.
 The easiest way to implement this incentive would be to recruit all participant
s, consolidate data on their book selections, and fulfill all orders at
 once.
 This timing was infeasible, however, because Amazon MTurk workers typically
 expect to receive their bonus compensation within a few days after taking
 the study.
 We could not, therefore, wait until the end of our three-month recruitment
 period.
 We solved this problem by fulfilling orders in one-week 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

waves.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Each week, we made a list of book selections made by the participants who
 took the study in the previous seven days.
 We then conducted a lottery, selected the winners, manually purchased the
 books on Amazon, and sent the personalized redemption links to participants
 via the Amazon Mechanical Turk API.
 We also sent participants their personalized bonuses at that time.
 To avoid being flagged by Amazon for suspicious activity, we purchased
 all books using an Amazon Business Account affiliated with our university.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Prior to using the business account, we tried using one of our individual
 Amazon accounts.

 large numbers of products without special authorization of the online retailer.
\end_layout

 When participants received redemption links, they were told that they would
 have two weeks to redeem their books.
 After two weeks, we logged which books were still unredeemed and returned
 any unclaimed books for a full refund from Amazon.

Ideally, each person would participate in our study only once, answer all
 pre-experiment questions in the Qualtrics survey, use the code we assigned
 them to check out exactly one book, and return to the Qualtrics survey
 to answer all post-survey questions.
 Despite our best efforts to enforce these rules, some people attempted
 to fill out the survey multiple times or returned to the bookstore after
 the study to try to purchase another e-book.
 In this section, we discuss how we processed raw data to make sure these
 attempts to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

game the system
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 did not contaminate our main experimental sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When constructing the main sample for estimation, we applied the following
 selection criteria.
 First, when we saw the same person attempting the Qualtrics survey multiple
 times, we only considered the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

successful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 attempt and ignored any subsequent attempts.
 We call an attempt successful if the person passed the comprehension checks,
 was assigned a unique code, and used this code at the entry gate of our
 bookstore.
 To verify the code usage, we searched in the Google Analytics data (search
 data) for a user that entered this unique code at the entry gate during
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appropriate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 time period, i.e., between the time when the survey attempt was started and
 finished according to Qualtrics.
 Given this selection rule, a person who took the survey once but did not
 pass comprehension checks was removed from the dataset.
 A person who failed comprehension checks the first time but then returned
 and passed them the second time was included in the dataset as long as
 they used their unique code in the bookstore on the second attempt.
 If the same person returned to the bookstore again, their third visit was
 excluded; in this case, we kept only their second visit in the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exception to this rule are the participants who answered all pre-shopping
 and post-shopping questions in Qualtrics, but whose codes were not recorded
 within the Google Analytics data.
 This scenario could occur if a person completed the entire study but used
 an ad blocker that prevented us from collecting their browsing data.

 Upon checkout, the store generates a password that the participant has
 to enter in Qualtrics in order to access the remaining questions and complete
 the study.
 Therefore, a participant who attempts to skip the bookstore would realize
 that they do not have the password they need to proceed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Because we have no way of matching these participants to their search data,
 we dropped these survey attempts from the data.

 In the final dataset, we observe a cross-section of participants and the
 time periods during which these participants took their first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Using the assigned unique checkout codes, we merge Qualtrics data from
 these participants with individual-level search data from Google Analytics.

 We asked them to return to the Qualtrics survey and use the password to
 access additional questions.
 Thus, even if a participant did not generate any search data (e.g., due to
 a privacy-enhancing browser), we knew which book they purchased from the
 password they entered.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For each individual, we only retrieved search data for the appropriate
 period between the start and the end of the relevant survey attempt.
 Therefore, if a website user returned to our bookstore after the study
 trying to check out another book, their browsing activity after the experiment
 was dropped from the dataset.

\begin_layout Standard
Some participants were assigned to a treatment condition but either i) did
 not complete the check-out process, ii) did not return to the Qualtrics
 survey after checking out, or iii) used a privacy-preserving tool that
 prevents us from collecting their browsing data.
 While some attrition is expected, differential attrition across treatment
 groups could generate bias.
 We test for differential attrition using a sample of 
\begin_inset Formula $7,479$
\end_inset

 participants who took the study after July 13, 2022.
 As described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:two_randomizations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, on that date we switched to a different randomization procedure that recorded
 experimental assignments before participants visited the bookstore.
 Because we observe the treatment assignments of all participants, including
 those that were eventually excluded from the sample, we can conduct a formal
 attrition analysis.
 We unfortunately cannot perform the same test for participants recruited
 prior to July 13 because we do not always observe their treatment assignments.

Using these data, we estimate the following regression:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{Completed Survey}_{i}=\alpha+\sum_{j=1}^{6}\beta_{j}\cdot T_{i}^{j}+\varepsilon_{i}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the mean attrition rate in the no advertising condition and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

is an indicator that participant 
\emph on

\emph on

 None of the ad conditions have significantly different attrition rates
 from the control group at the 5% significance level.
 We also cannot reject the hypothesis that all six ad conditions have the
 same attrition probability as the no advertising condition (joint 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.64$

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\emph{p}-value}=0.132$

Finally, Table

 across the seven experimental conditions, as well as the 
\emph on

\emph default
-values of joint significance 
\emph on
F
\emph default
-tests.
 While there are some minor differences in the averages of pre-treatment
 covariates across groups, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal
 means for 23 out of 24 covariates.
 One exception is that participants assigned to the no-advertising group
 are about 7 months older than participants assigned to the advertising
 conditions.
 Although the difference is significant at the 10% level, the difference
 appears economically small.
 We also simultaneously tested the null hypothesis of equal means for all
 24 covariates by estimating a system of seemingly unrelated regressions
 (SUR), which generates a joint significance

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal in this experiment was to create a store that would induce participants
 to make realistic book choices.
 To understand whether we achieved this goal, we present several validation
 analyses.
 First, we use experimental data to verify that consumers engage in meaningful
 search in our store and make choices consistent with their self-reported
 preferences.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_search"
plural "false"

 and in the left panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_comscore"

\end_inset

, consumers engage in active search.
 Consumers spend, on average, 3.7 minutes when shopping in our bookstore.
 The average consumer opens 4.0 pages in the product list, which includes
 pages in the default-sorted list as well as any pages opened after applying
 filters, sorting books by price, or using search queries.
 There is substantial heterogeneity in how much consumers search: around
 35% of consumers only view the first page of the assortment, and at the
 other extreme, 15% of consumers open at least 10 pages.
 The average consumer also visits 3.3 product pages
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AT: I couldn't replicate this number - 3.3 - because I had trouble finding
 which variable records this.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, including revisits, and searches 1.9 unique books.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the observed book choices align with participants' self-reported
 genre preferences.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_genre_choice"

\end_inset

 plots the probability of purchasing a book of a specific genre as a function
 of which genre the consumer reported liking most.
 All five figures show that a consumer is about twice as likely to purchase
 a book in their most preferred genre than a book of any other genre offered
 in the store.
 For example, a consumer purchases a fantasy book with a 26%
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
25.7%
\end_layout

\end_inset

 probability if their most preferred genre is fantasy and with only a 5-13%
 probability if they prefer some other genre.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:validation_purchases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 additionally describes the distribution of purchases across different subcatego
ries of books by genre and price.
 Reassuringly, we do not observe that consumers focus their purchases on
 a few books on the front page, which is what we would see if their only
 goal was to quickly finish the study and get their cash bonus.
 In fact, all 100 books in the assortment are purchased at least once (column
 3), and the purchases are not overly concentrated on one popular book,
 even within each subcategory (columns 5-9).
 Within most genre subcategories, consumers are more likely to buy inexpensive
 books that cost under $1.00; however, some consumers do purchase more expensive
 books.
 Our incentive-compatible experiment design has therefore made consumers
 price sensitive, but not overly so because we do not see them always choosing
 the most inexpensive books to maximize the cash bonus.
 Based on these results, we conclude that our experiment design has elicited
 meaningful search behavior and has induced consumers to make realistic
 choices that align with their book preferences.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now compare our data to an external dataset that tracks the search behavior
 of real consumers in the category of books on Amazon.
 We analyze the Comscore Web-Behavior Panel 2019-2020, which includes approximat
ely 2 million U.S.
 households.
 Households install software on their computers that tracks their online
 browsing activity on all websites and logs their online transactions.
 These data enable us to identify all instances in which a household visited
 a product page on Amazon–not necessarily for a book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then classify all product page visits into product categories using a
 dataset of Amazon products obtained from a third-party service, Keepa,
 that repeatedly tracks product pages on Amazon.
 Using these additional data, we restrict the dataset to product pages of
 books, and we identify all books that fall into the same five categories
 that are represented in our store: biography/memoir, fantasy, mystery/thriller,
 romance, and science fiction.
 Given that we populated the store using books sold on Amazon, the definitions
 of book genres in our dataset are fully consistent with the genre categories
 we observe in the Keepa dataset.

 These selection steps leave us with a sample of 171,429 households, with
 each household searching in 4.6 sessions on average.
 We combine the search data with users' online transactions, also obtained
 from Comscore, and we compare the extent to which the distribution of searches
 and purchases across genres matches our observations in our experiment.

 We find that the two distributions look almost identical.
 Consumers search little in both datasets: around 62% of consumers search
 only one book, 18% search two books, and less than 3% search ten books
 or more.
 The average number of searches is 2.19 in Comscore data, which is similar
 to the 1.93 in our sample.
 It is reassuring that consumers in our experiment search as much as Amazon
 customers, which supports the idea that our store elicits realistic search
 behavior.

 reports how searches and purchases are distributed across books of the
 five focal genres.
 Column 1 shows the average number of searched books of a given genre in
 the Comscore dataset, column 2 reports the same numbers but in percentage
 terms, and column 3 shows the proportion of transactions by genre.
 In columns 4-6, we reproduce the same summary statistics using our dataset.
 In general, we find somewhat different search and purchase patterns in
 the two datasets.
 Most notably, relative to our data, Comscore households are more likely
 to search and purchase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Romance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 books and are less likely to select books from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fantasy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sci-fi
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 subcategories.
 It is possible that this discrepancy arises because, compared to our sample,
 Comscore oversamples older consumers and consumers with low income, which
 tend to purchase more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Romance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and fewer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sci-fi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 books than the average consumer.
 Nevertheless, we do find that the three most popular genres in our data
 – 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Romance,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mystery/Thriller,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Biography/Memoir
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are also the three most popular genres in the Comscore dataset, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fantasy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sci-fi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are the least popular in both datasets.
 We therefore conclude that, although the choices we observe in the experiment
 differ from those of Comscore consumers, they reflect somewhat similar
 genre preferences.

 spillovers in our experiment.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:location_spillovers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we visualize the effects of advertising 
\shape italic
Lost Girls
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
Stateline
\shape default
 on the purchase rates of the 20 books located on the first two pages of
 the store.
 Each graph orders books by their ranking in the default list.
 As expected, advertising substantially increases the purchase rate of the
 advertised books, consistent with strong advertising effects in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ate_bothbooks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Interestingly, we also find that advertising lifts demand for books located
 close to the advertising banner.
 At the 10% significance level, advertisements for 
\shape italic
Lost Girls
\shape default
 increase demand for four books: 
\shape italic
Rhapsodic
\shape default
 (rank 2), 
\shape italic
A Ruin of Roses
\shape default
 (rank 3), 
\shape italic
Every Little Secret
\shape default
 (rank 5), and 
\shape italic
Rebound Love
\shape default
 (rank 8).
 At the same time, these ads reduce demand for 
\shape italic
Mrs.
 Kennedy and Me
\shape default
 (rank 1) and 
\shape italic
Dead by Sunset
\shape default
 (rank 6).
 We find virtually identical effects for the advertisements for 
\shape italic
Stateline
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these effects are not directly predicted by spatial search models,
 they are consistent with the following attention hypothesis.
 A salient advertising banner draws consumers' attention to itself while
 generating attention spillovers to other nearby books.
 Such attention spillovers would explain why advertising increases demand
 for books located directly under the advertising banner.
 An interesting puzzle in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:location_spillovers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is why advertising reduces the purchase rate of the books in the first
 and sixth positions.
 We speculate that, given the store layout, consumers naturally examine
 the assortment from top to bottom and from left to right, which generates
 position effects.
 The advertising banner may then disrupt the normal flow of search and weaken
 the position effects.
 Such an effect may explain why the two books in the leftmost column of
 the first page lose popularity.
 The excess demand is then re-distributed toward appealing books that are
 located closer to the banner.
 This phenomenon would explain why advertising increases demand for the
 book 
\shape italic
Every Little Secret
\shape default
, which has the highest purchase rate (12.6%) among books in our assortment.
 A promising direction for future research might be to further test this
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attention spillover
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hypothesis by randomizing the location of the ad banner.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One could randomize both the location of the ad banner in the store and
 the rankings of books, thus varying the location of the advertising banner
 relative to the organic listings of non-advertised books.
 Eye-tracking software may also help reveal whether the advertising banner
 changes how consumers visually examine books on store pages.
