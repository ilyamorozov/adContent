\paragraph_spacing single
We study how advertising content influences consumers' decisions.
 To this end, we create a simulated online bookstore that imitates a real
 online shopping experience.
 We then conduct a pre-registered and incentive-compatible experiment in
 which we randomly expose store visitors to display ads, randomizing both
 advertising exposures and content.
 We find that ad content plays a major role in shaping advertising effects.
 Ads that reveal a book's low price consistently increase demand for the
 advertised book relative to ads that do not reveal price.
 By contrast, ads that reveal the book's genre induce some consumers to
 search and buy the book but lead others to reject it without search.
 We show these polarized responses can increase or decrease the total number
 of searches and purchases of the advertised book depending on the share
 of consumers who favor the revealed genre.
 Our findings suggest that advertisers should carefully choose which product
 attributes to reveal in their ad copies.
 We also show that revealing product attributes in ads does not change the
 total amount of search.
 Taken together, our results suggest the primary role of ad content is to
 affect consumers' beliefs about the advertised book rather than to alter
 the perceived benefits from search.

An advertisement is like the opening act of a play: presenting the right
 information can engage the audience from the first curtain rise, while
 failing to do so may squander their attention.
 Accordingly, the success of a campaign may depend on which product attributes
 firms choose to spotlight in their ads.
 By advertising specific attributes, firms hope to entice consumers into
 considering their product more closely.
 Chevrolet and Ford, for instance, highlight horsepower, fuel efficiency,
 and durability in their truck ads, while Apple and Samsung emphasize the
 battery life, camera quality, and price of their smartphones.
 Although there is broad consensus that choosing the right ad content can
 indeed play a crucial role in driving ad effects

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we study how consumers respond to ad content that reveals
 product attributes, and we provide both theoretical and empirical results
 to guide firms in making their ad content choices.
 Studying these questions presents several challenges.
 Most researchers do not observe ad creatives and can only present indirect
 evidence of ad content effects.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\noindent
A few studies that do not observe ad content present indirect evidence suggestin
g that consumers learn product attributes from ads.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "anand2011advertising"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 document that consumers make choices that seem more aligned with their
 tastes after being exposed to ads, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ackerberg2001empirically"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 shows that advertising primarily affects consumers who have little experience
 with the advertised brand.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Even when they do observe ad content, it is hard to disentangle how different
 elements of multi-dimensional ad creatives shape advertising effects.
 Further, researchers need to address endogeneity concerns that arise because
 firms target ads at specific consumer segments and during particular time
 periods.
 For example, firms may advertise prices during the season of holiday discounts,
 in which case the ad content consumers see will correlate with temporary
 demand changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address these challenges, we design and implement an experiment that
 randomizes both advertising exposures and content.
 Using web development tools, we create a simulated online bookstore that
 imitates a real online shopping experience.
 We then conduct a pre-registered experiment in which we recruit around
 11,500 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk and ask each of them to select
 an e-book from our store.
 When participants visit the store, we expose them to display ads, randomizing
 whether an ad is shown and also whether the ad copy reveals the book's
 genre (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

genre ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), its price (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

price ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), or does not reveal any attributes other than the title and cover image
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plain ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The participants then browse the store and purchase e-books as they normally
 would when shopping online.
 We record the entire search process using advanced tracking tools.
 To elicit realistic shopping behavior, we make the experiment incentive-compati
ble by sending participants the e-books they selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using experimental data, we study the effects of advertising content on
 consumers' decisions.
 Laying the foundation for our main analysis, we first estimate 
\emph on
exposure effects
\emph default
 by comparing the behavior of consumers under plain ads to that in the no
 ad control group.
 Exposure effects may arise because ads signal the book's high quality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nelson1974advertising,milgrom1986price"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or because they help consumers discover the advertised book and offer an
 easy way to click through to the book's product page 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "arbatskaya2007ordered,armstrong2009prominence,haan2011advertising"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Consistent with these theories, we find that plain ads substantially increase
 the search and purchase rates of the advertised book.
 These 
\shape italic
\emph on

\emph default
s establish a benchmark against which we measure the incremental effects
 of revealing attributes in ads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to our main analysis, we estimate 
\shape italic
content effects
\shape default
 by studying how consumers respond to attribute ads relative to plain ads.
 Using a simple search model, we formulate hypotheses on how attribute ads
 should affect consumers' search and purchase decisions.
 In our experiment, attribute ads reveal either a book's low price – a vertical
 attribute that appeals to all consumers (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

price ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) – or genre – a horizontal attribute that indicates the book's match value
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

genre ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The model predicts that revealing a low price should weakly induce all
 consumers to search and purchase the advertised book.
 By contrast, revealing genre should induce some consumers to search the
 book because they learn it matches their tastes while discouraging others
 from searching it because they learn it is a bad match.

 The attention model of

 In their model, advertising can generate negative effects when it helps
 consumers eliminate an unappealing option that does not match their tastes.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find our experimental results to be remarkably consistent with these
 theoretical predictions.
 Relative to plain ads, price ads increase searches and purchases of the
 advertised book regardless of consumers' genre preferences.
 Revealing price makes the ad, on average, 26% more effective at driving
 searches and 35% more effective at driving purchases.
 By contrast, genre ads induce polarized responses relative to plain ads:
 consumers who favor the revealed genre become more likely to search the
 book, while those who do not favor the genre discard the book without searching.
 As a result, revealing genre makes the ad more or less effective depending
 on the share of consumers who favor the revealed genre.
 For example, revealing a mainstream mystery genre makes the ad 15% more
 effective at driving searches and 12% more effective at driving purchases,
 whereas revealing a niche romance genre makes the ad less effective, decreasing
 ad effects on searches by 31% and on purchases by 16%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a high level, our results suggest revealing attributes in ads can influence
 choices by changing consumers' beliefs about the advertised book's attributes.
 At the same time, we find that ad content does not significantly alter
 how consumers conduct their search or how satisfied they are with their
 final choices.
 For example, price ads do not make consumers more likely to sort books
 by price or search other inexpensive books, and genre ads do not lead consumers
 to use genre-related filters or to search other non-advertised books of
 the same genre.
 Revealing attributes in ads also does not change the total number of books
 consumers search or the time they spend searching.
 Thus, in our setting, ad content primarily affects consumers' beliefs about
 the advertised book's attributes instead of changing attribute salience
 or altering the perceived benefits from searching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings have several implications for managers who design ad campaigns.
 We document that revealing an attribute in ads can generate a spectrum
 of effects, from strongly positive to strongly negative, depending on how
 consumers value the revealed attribute.
 Consequently, advertisers should understand the distribution of tastes
 across consumers before choosing which attributes to reveal in their ads.
 Advertisers may also benefit from jointly optimizing the content of their
 ads and the scope of their advertising campaigns.
 If the product's attributes are relatively niche, the advertiser may want
 to run a targeted campaign, selectively revealing these attributes to consumers
 who value them the most.
 Our results suggest there can be meaningful gains from such targeting:
 we show that targeting genre and price ads based on estimated conditional
 ad effects increases the search probability by 14% relative to the best
 non-targeted policy.
 By contrast, an advertiser restricted to mass advertising campaigns may
 want to reveal appealing vertical attributes such as a low price.

 Although these correlations are suggestive, they might be misleading if

 evidence that consumers' responses to ad content are consistent with the

Following

 Upon visiting the store, the consumer observes 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{d}$
\end_inset

 books on the front page, which form the initial awareness set, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$

 The consumer learns the prices

 of these books but not their genres 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{j}$
\end_inset

 or attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ij}$

 We make this assumption because in our bookstore consumers see prices on
 product list pages, but they need to click on books to learn their genres
 and other attributes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After seeing the initial set of books 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$

, the consumer sequentially decides whether to discover additional books,
 search a previously discovered book, or purchase a previously searched
 book.
 The consumer can discover additional books by navigating to the next product
 list page, which adds 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{d}$

 books to the awareness set and reveals their prices.
 To discover books from page

 Alternatively, the consumer can search an already discovered book by navigating

 To search a book, the consumer must pay the search cost

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal is to study the effects of ad content over and above any effect
 of being exposed to an ad.
 To this end, we first establish a benchmark for measuring ad content effects.
 Consider a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plain ad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for book 
\begin_inset Formula $k\notin S_{0}$
\end_inset

 of genre 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 whose organic listing resides on page 
\begin_inset Formula $l(k)>1$
\end_inset

 and suppose this ad does not reveal any attributes other than the book's
 title and cover image.
 We assume a plain ad moves the book into the consumer's default awareness
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

, reducing its discovery cost to zero.
 Because the ad does not reveal genre or price, the consumer needs to pay
 a search cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 to reveal these attributes.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In our experiment, we only advertise books whose names and covers are relatively
 nondescript.
 Therefore, it makes sense to assume that consumers cannot infer other book
 attributes from the plain ads.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Proposition 1 shows that the plain ad increases the search and purchase
 probabilities of the advertised book 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, assuming this book's initial discovery cost is sufficiently high.
 We relegate all proofs of this section to Appendix

Proposition 1 (Exposure Effects).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A plain ad increases the average search and purchase probabilities of the

 is sufficiently high.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Both mechanisms predict that a plain ad should increase searches and purchases
 of the advertised book.
 Because separating these explanations is not our main focus, we remain
 agnostic about the mechanisms behind exposure effects and instead turn
 to modeling the incremental effects of ad content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an ad that reveals a horizontal attribute, the book's genre.
 We assume a genre ad generates the same exposure effects as a plain ad,
 but it additionally reveals the book's genre to consumers.
 Revealing genre 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

 sends consumers a noisy signal of utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{ik}$
\end_inset

, but they still need to pay the search cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 to learn the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 and attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ik}$

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Proposition 2 (Content Effects: Revealing Genre).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(a) Relative to a plain ad, a genre ad increases the search and purchase
 probabilities for consumers who like the revealed genre (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}>0$
\end_inset

), decreases them for consumers who dislike the revealed genre (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}<0$
\end_inset

), and does not change them for indifferent consumers (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}=0$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
(b) Relative to a plain ad, a genre ad increases the average search and
 purchase probabilities of the advertised book if there is a sufficient
 share of consumers who like this book's genre.
 On the other hand, a genre ad decreases the average search and purchase
 probabilities if there is a sufficient share of consumers who dislike the
 genre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To gain intuition, suppose a publisher of the book 
\shape italic
The Shadow of the Gods
\shape default
 by John Gwynne advertises the book as a fantasy story about mages and dragons.
 After seeing this ad, fantasy lovers may become more interested in inspecting
 this book, as they have just learned that it matches their tastes well.
 By contrast, readers who dislike fantasy may conclude that this book is
 not for them.
 Learning its genre from the ad has convinced them that they should reject
 the book without searching.
 As Proposition 2a shows, advertising should then increase searches and
 purchases of this book among fantasy lovers and reduce them among consumers
 who prefer other genres, leading to polarized decisions.
 In turn, Proposition 2b implies that the net impact of these effects is
 ambiguous.
 In fact, the total demand for the advertised book may decrease if the negative
 response from consumers who dislike fantasy outweighs the positive response
 from fantasy aficionados.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider an ad that reveals a vertical attribute – the book's price.
 As with genre ads, a price ad generates the same exposure effects as a
 plain ad but additionally reveals the book's price to consumers.
 Revealing price sends consumers a noisy signal of utility, but consumers
 still need to pay the search cost 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 to learn the remaining attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ik}$
\end_inset

.
 Proposition 3 posits how consumers should react to price ads:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Proposition 3 (Content Effects: Revealing Price).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following two results hold if the advertised book is sufficiently inexpensiv
e:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
(a) Relative to a plain ad, a price ad increases the search and purchase
 probabilities of individual consumers regardless of their genre tastes
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
(b) Relative to a plain ad, a price ad increases the average search and
 purchase probabilities of the advertised book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset

 When the ad reveals that book 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is unusually cheap, as is the case in our experiment, all consumers view
 the revealed price as a positive signal of utility and thus become more
 likely to search the book.
 Although they still do not know this book's other attributes, the book
 now looks more appealing than it did before they saw the ad (Proposition
 3a).
 This positive effect on search translates into additional purchases, thus
 increasing the average purchase probability of the advertised book relative
 to that under the plain ad (Proposition 3b).

 The store has 10 product list pages, and all consumers initially land on
 the first page.
 Consumers can navigate to other product list pages by clicking on buttons
 at the bottom of each product list page.
 Following the standard layout of online bookstores, such as Amazon or Barnes
 & Noble, we design product list pages so that they reveal basic information
 about books including the title, author, price, and cover image.
 Throughout our experiment, we keep books' prices and rankings the same
 for all consumers.
 Clicking on a book in the product list directs the consumer to the product
 page, which additionally reveals the genre of the book and a detailed descripti
on of its plot (see Appendix Figure

 To achieve this, we take books from Amazon bestseller lists and select
 20 books of each genre that are priced under $3.
 We set the books' prices equal to the current Amazon prices, which range

When choosing which books to advertise, we select books for which demand

 Advertising an unappealing book would have little effect on choices, which

 To avoid this issue, we select the mystery book

The Lost Girls of Ireland
\shape default
 (henceforth 
\emph on

 Both books are relatively popular within their genre subcategories on Amazon
 (e.g., customer ratings 4.2 and 4.3 out of 5 on Amazon).
 To enhance the appeal of these books, we reduce their prices from the original
 $2.99 on Amazon to $0.99, thus making them among the cheapest books in our
 store.
 We also choose these books because they have nondescript titles and covers
 that do not obviously reveal the book's genre, which helps us isolate the
 incremental effect of revealing genre in the ads.
 We place both books on the second page of the default product list to ensure
 we are not advertising options that are already salient.
 This placement also matches our theoretical setting in Section

After the experiment, we conducted the lottery, manually bought books from
 Amazon, and sent personalized bonuses and book redemption links to the
 lottery winners.
 Participants could redeem and read their e-book using a free Amazon Kindle
 app on their e-book reader, browser, or phone.
 Because the purchased e-books could only be redeemed from the U.S., we only
 recruited participants who reside in the U.S.

Participants were told that the study investigates their preferences for
 e-books.
 They first filled out a Qualtrics survey in which they reported their demograph
ics and were asked to rank five book genres from their most preferred to
 their least preferred.
 We then informed participants about the incentive structure, explained
 that their choices would have real consequences, and asked them a comprehension
 question to ensure they understood their incentives.

After checking out, participants returned to the Qualtrics survey, and we
 asked them what they would prefer to do if they won our lottery: receive
 their selected book and the remainder of their $3 budget or forfeit the
 book and keep the entire $3 budget.
 The purpose of this question was to assess whether participants were genuinely
 interested in reading the books they selected.

Experimental Data and Estimation

\noindent
Our main sample includes participants who passed the comprehension checks,
 purchased a book in our store, and returned to the Qualtrics survey after
 completing the checkout process.
 Despite our instructions to use a standard browser, approximately 18% of
 the participants either used ad blockers or privacy-enhancing browsers
 that made it impossible for us to track their actions.
 We exclude these participants from the sample.
 Because participants are unlikely to change their browser privacy settings
 in response to seeing ads in our bookstore, we assume that this selection
 criterion is orthogonal to the experimental assignment.
 We further tested whether there was differential attrition across experimental
 conditions but found no evidence of such imbalances (joint 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.64$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.132$
\end_inset

).
 Our final sample includes 
\begin_inset Formula $N=11,498$

 participants for whom we have complete browsing and purchase data.

To understand whether we have generated realistic search and purchase behavior,
 we conduct several validation analyses (see Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:data_validation_comscore"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 First, we show that consumers engage in meaningful search: the average
 consumer spends 3.7 minutes in the store, opens 4.0 product list pages, and
 searches 1.9 unique books (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_search"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This search behavior is broadly consistent with the search behavior of
 actual consumers shopping for books online (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_comscore"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), which we document using an external dataset from Comscore.
 Second, we show that consumers' book choices align with their self-reported
 genre preferences (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_genre_choice"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Third, we document that consumers do not exclusively purchase the cheapest
 books on the website to maximize their cash bonus (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:validation_purchases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Finally, more than 60% of all participants decided they would keep their
 book if they won our lottery, and 27% of those who received a link redeemed
 their books, suggesting they truly liked the books they selected.
 Based on these results, we conclude that our experiment elicits meaningful
 search behavior and induces consumers to make choices that align with their
 book preferences.

Having validated our experimental data, we use them to estimate how consumers
 respond to ad exposure and ad content.
 In all analyses, we estimate ad effects using a linear regression model
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}=\delta+\sum_{j=1}^{6}\beta_{j}\cdot T_{i}^{j}+\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$

 is the outcome variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the mean in the no advertising condition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{j}$
\end_inset

 are ad effects, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 is an indicator that participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 In Appendix

, we report randomization checks that use demographic variables and self-reporte

 While in some analyses the ATE estimates 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are of direct interest, we study ad content effects by computing the difference
s (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{genre}-\hat{\beta}_{plain}$
\end_inset

), thus estimating the incremental effect of ad content relative to the
 effect of plain ads.

We start by estimating the effects of ads that do not explicitly reveal
 any attribute information.
 To this end, we estimate consumers' responses to plain ads relative to
 the control condition with no ads.
 The effects of plain ads establish a benchmark against which we measure
 the effects of ad content.

 in Panel A and 
\shape italic
Stateline

 in Panel B.
 Consistent with Proposition 1, we find that showing a plain ad significantly
 increases the search and purchase probabilities of the advertised books.
 Advertising 
\shape italic
Lost Girls

 makes the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $0.071/0.052\approx137\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

) more likely to search this book by visiting its product page and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.037/0.028\approx132\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

) more likely to purchase it.
 We find even stronger advertising effects for 
\shape italic
Stateline

.
 Showing a plain ad for this book makes consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $0.072/0.050\approx144\%$

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

 These exposure effects are primarily driven by clicks on the ad banner
 itself, rather than clicks on the organic product listing or product recommenda
tions.

 for the advertised book.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, these exposure effects could arise because plain ads make consumers aware

 Instead, we now turn to discussing the incremental effects of ad content.

 The effects on purchase probabilities are directionally the same but not

 By contrast, revealing price makes the ad more effective for both books.
 For

 We find similar effects for

 As these estimates suggest, revealing different book attributes in ads

reference "sec:theory"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Consider first the effects of revealing genre.
 Our model rests on the assumption that consumers cannot infer genre from
 the book's title and cover art, and thus the genre ad reveals new information
 relative to the plain ad.
 To test whether this assumption holds, we look for evidence of differential
 search patterns in the plain ads condition.
 If consumers exposed to a plain ad can infer the advertised book's genre,
 then those who favor that genre should search the book more frequently
 than others.
 Column 1 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows mixed evidence.
 After being exposed to a plain ad for 
\emph on
Lost Girls
\emph default
, consumers who favor romance novels have a lower baseline search rate than
 others.
 However, after exposure to a plain ad for 
\emph on
Stateline
\emph default
, consumers who prefer the mystery genre have a higher baseline search rate,
 suggesting they can partially infer this book's genre.
 Although this partial inference can weaken our experimental manipulation
 for 
\emph on
Stateline
\emph default
, genre ads should still polarize consumers' search decisions as long as
 some consumers cannot infer genres from titles and book covers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proposition 2a predicts that genre ads may polarize consumers' search decisions
 relative to plain ads.
 Figure

a provides a direct test of this proposition.
 The figure visualizes the average search rate of the advertised book under
 genre ads (red dashed line) and plain ads (blue solid line) for five groups
 of consumers who differ by their stated preference for the advertised genre.
 Consistent with the proposition, revealing genre increases the search probabili
ty among consumers who favor this genre, has little effect on consumers
 who ranked this genre second, and substantially decreases the search probabilit
y among all other consumers.

We formally test these effects in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:match_value"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 by estimating the ATE of genre ads on search and purchase probabilities
 relative to plain ads.
 To maximize statistical power, we pool consumers into two groups: those
 who ranked the advertised book's genre as their most preferred genre and
 everyone else.
 Panels A and B present results separately for each book, and in Panel C
 we pool data from both books.
 Focusing on the pooled estimates, we find that revealing genre significantly
 increases the search probability of the advertised book for consumers who
 favor its genre by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.050/0.139\approx36\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.005$
\end_inset

) and significantly decreases it by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.024/0.118\approx20\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.003$
\end_inset

) for all other consumers.
 We also show suggestive evidence that these effects translate into purchases:
 revealing genre increases the advertised book's purchase rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.024/0.092\approx26\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.104$
\end_inset

) for consumers who favor the advertised genre and decreases the purchase
 rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.007/0.063\approx11\%$
\end_inset

 among all others (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.245$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This polarization result explains why revealing genre in 
\emph on
Stateline 
\emph default
ads increases the aggregate search probability but revealing genre in 
\emph on
Lost Girls
\emph default
 ads decreases it.
 As Proposition 2b shows, because revealing genre polarizes consumers' responses
, the overall effectiveness of a genre ad depends on the share of consumers
 who favor the advertised genre.
 In our sample, consumers rank the mystery genre much higher on average
 than the romance genre (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hist_genre_preferences"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For this reason, revealing the genre of a mystery book generates strong
 positive effects on searches that offset the negative effects on consumers
 who dislike the genre.
 By contrast, revealing the genre of a romance book generates mostly negative
 effects on search, which overpower the positive effects among the smaller
 group of consumers who like romance novels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, to explain why price ads appear to be the most effective at driving
 searches and purchases, we turn to Proposition 3.
 Specifically, Proposition 3a posits that revealing price should increase
 the search and purchase probabilities of the advertised book for all consumers
 regardless of their genre preferences, assuming the revealed price is sufficien
tly appealing.
 The latter assumption holds in our experiment because price ads reveal
 the advertised book to be one of the cheapest options in the store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this prediction, in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:demand_rotations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

b we visualize the average search rate of the advertised book under price
 ads (red dashed line) and plain ads (blue solid line) for the same five
 consumer groups based on their stated genre preferences.
 Relative to plain ads, price ads increase the search probabilities in all
 consumer groups.
 We analyze these differences formally in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:price_ads_by_genre"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Consistent with Proposition 3a, the price ad directionally increases the
 search rate by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.020/0.139\approx14\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.244$
\end_inset

) among consumers who ranked the advertised genre first and by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.017/0.118\approx14\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.059$
\end_inset

) among all other consumers.
 Once again, these effects on search translate into purchases: revealing
 price directionally increases purchases among consumers who rate the advertised
 genre first 
\begin_inset Formula $0.005/0.092\approx5\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.717$
\end_inset

) and significantly increases purchases by 
\begin_inset Formula $0.018/0.063\approx28\%$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.010$
\end_inset

) among all other consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These uniform responses explain why price ads are highly effective in our
 experiment.
 Consistent with Proposition 3a, a low price ad induces positive responses
 among all consumers regardless of their genre preferences, thus increasing
 the average search and purchase probabilities of the advertised book (Propositi
on 3b).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put together, our experimental results show that ad content plays a substantial
 role in shaping advertising effects, and our theoretical model clarifies
 the mechanisms behind these content effects.
 When an ad reveals a favorable vertical attribute, such as a low price,
 the effects of ad content are positive across consumers with different
 genre preferences because all consumers positively update their beliefs
 about the book.
 By contrast, revealing a horizontal attribute, such as the book's genre,
 attracts some consumers while discouraging others from searching the book.
 Importantly, revealing a niche genre that few consumers like but many dislike
 significantly reduces searches and directionally reduces purchases of the
 advertised book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spillover Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have so far discussed how ad content influences searches and purchases
 of the advertised book.
 In practice, advertising content effects might also spill over to non-advertise
d books.
 Although our search model does not directly predict these spillovers, the
 prior empirical literature has presented evidence that ad exposure increases
 demand for products that are similar to the advertised option

\end_layout

\end_inset

 In the case of ad content, revealing an attribute in ads could make it
 more salient to consumers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mackenzie-1986"

\end_inset

, which may lead them to focus on other books with this attribute.
 Genre ads may then encourage consumers to seek other books of the same
 genre, and price ads may lead them to examine other cheap books offered
 in the store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both advertisers and platforms could benefit from knowing whether such spillover
s occur.
 An advertiser, for example, may have little interest in revealing attributes
 in ads if it knows that doing so will increase demand for similar products
 sold by competitors.
 Further, a platform might want to understand whether price ads for individual
 products can make consumers more price-sensitive, thus changing the platform's
 pricing incentives.

, we test for spillover effects using several outcome variables.
 First, if a price ad induces consumers to search other inexpensive books,
 consumers may sort books by price to locate other cheap options.
 In the same vein, if a genre ad encourages consumers to seek other books
 of the same genre, they may use filters to navigate to the relevant genre
 subcategory.

-values between 
\begin_inset Formula $0.108$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.986$
\end_inset

 Second, even without inducing consumers to use different search tools,
 ad content could still make them more likely to click on the organic listings
 of similar books.
 We test for this effect but find little evidence that price ads increase
 the search or purchase probabilities of other inexpensive books priced
 below $1 (
\emph on
p
\emph default
-values 
\begin_inset Formula $0.599$

 The ad banner then disrupts the normal flow of search and weakens these

 – these books would normally be the most salient.
 The advertising banner might draw attention away from these books and toward
 books that are located near the banner itself.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results shed light on how ads with varied content influence consumers'
 search and purchase decisions.
 So far, however, we have been silent on whether any of these effects benefit
 consumers.
 Ads could save consumers time by reducing the number of books they need
 to examine before finding a good match, or they could divert consumers'
 search toward a low quality option and increase the amount of time needed
 to find a good book.
 The welfare effects of ads will also depend on whether the books consumers
 choose after seeing ads match their preferences better or worse than the
 books they would choose without ads.
 Understanding these effects might be of particular interest for platforms
 that want to know whether showing ads on their websites can improve the
 shopping experience and increase customer retention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although a complete welfare analysis is outside the scope of this paper,
 here we explore the effects of ads on several proxies for consumer welfare.
 Appendix Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 visualizes the effects of different ads on measures of overall search effort.
 Relative to no ads, a plain ad leads consumers to search 10% fewer books
 (from 
\begin_inset Formula $2.14$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.92$
\end_inset

 similarly finds that targeted offers for an online store reduce the total
 search activity on the retailer's website.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These results suggest that plain ads induce consumers to search less.
 As long as this reduction in search does not lead to decreased customer
 satisfaction, it could be welfare-enhancing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we test whether consumers exposed to plain ads are more or less satisfied
 with their final choices than those in the no ad condition.
 If consumers exposed to plain ads are more satisfied with their purchases,
 they should be more likely to keep their selected book instead of choosing
 the cash after the experiment.
 We find that exposure to a plain ad does not significantly change the probabili
ty that consumers keep their selected book (from 0.615 to 0.614, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.966$
\end_inset


\emph on
)
\emph default
.
 Thus, although plain ads help consumers make their choices with less search,
 they do not necessarily improve the quality of these choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad content may amplify both of these effects.
 Genre ads, for instance, may help consumers quickly find a book with a
 high match value, reducing the time they need to spend on search.
 Our data do not support this conjecture: relative to plain ads, attribute
 ads do not generate incremental effects on the number of searched books,
 number of opened product list pages, shopping time, or the probability
 of keeping the book (see Appendix Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ads_and_total_search"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 These findings suggest that revealing product attributes in ad creatives
 does not save consumers time and does not change how satisfied consumers
 are with their final choices.
 We acknowledge, however, that the estimates presented in this section are
 noisy and that the decision of whether to keep the book after the study
 may not capture all facets of consumer satisfaction.

Discussion

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One takeaway from our experimental results is that advertisers should carefully
 choose which product attributes to reveal in ad copies.
 Our experiment shows that advertising the right attributes can get consumers
 interested to learn the remaining attributes, but highlighting the wrong
 ones can convince consumers that the product is not even worth examining.
 Therefore, it might be a good idea to avoid advertising attributes that
 are likely to induce polarized responses from consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Managers may also benefit from jointly optimizing the content of their ads
 and the scope of their advertising campaigns.
 A manager designing a mass advertising campaign might want to focus on
 advertising vertical attributes and avoid revealing niche product attributes
 that appeal to few consumers but repel many others.
 Alternatively, the manager can design a targeted campaign that selectively
 reveals a horizontal attribute.
 Our analysis suggests that the gains from such targeting can be sizable.
 For example, based on our estimates, showing the genre ad to consumers
 who favor mystery novels and the price ad to everyone else could increase
 the search probability of 
\emph on
Stateline
\emph default
 by 14% relative to showing the price ad to everyone.
 More generally, by highlighting the aspects of the product each consumer
 finds the most appealing, personalized ads could minimize negative ad content
 effects, thus increasing the ROI of advertising.
 The literature has documented that many firms successfully use consumer
 data for ad targeting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "johnson2017ghost,sahni2019experimental,wernerfelt2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our results suggest that firms might find it valuable to use such data
 for personalizing ad content as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conjecture that ad content may also affect demand elasticities and thus
 have downstream consequences for firms' pricing decisions.
 Price ads allow consumers to screen the advertised book on price and may
 thus 
\shape italic
rotate the book's demand curve counter-clockwise
\shape default
, incentivizing the advertiser to charge a lower price 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "robert1993informative,kaul1995empirical"

\end_inset

.
 By contrast, genre ads allow consumers to screen the advertised book based
 on how much they like the revealed genre, which may 
\shape italic
rotate the book's demand curve clockwise
\shape default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and incentivize the advertiser to charge a higher price 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "meurer1994informative"

\end_inset

.
 Our results show that consumers' responses to ad content are consistent
 with the theoretical predictions that lead to these demand rotations.
 A promising direction for future research would be to explicitly test for
 these rotations using data with exogenous variation in both ad content
 and prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we show that ad exposure reduces the total amount of search without
 affecting customers' satisfaction with their chosen book.
 This finding suggests an intriguing possibility that showing display ads
 on a platform might make shopping more efficient, which could potentially
 improve customer retention.
 Because we do not observe repeat store visits in our data, we leave testing
 this conjecture to future work.

Conclusions 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we create a simulated shopping environment in which consumers
 need to choose from an assortment of e-books while being exposed to display
 advertisements with varied content.
 Using data from an incentive-compatible experiment, we estimate how ad
 content causally influences consumer search and choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although there are benefits to creating a simulated store, this approach
 is not without limitations.
 Relative to major online bookstores, our store lacks customer ratings and
 reviews, which could serve as an alternative source of information about
 products and thus reduce the effects of ad content.
 Further, our limited book assortment and forced-choice design could lead
 to larger than normal ad effects in our setting.
 For this reason, we caution against interpreting our results as capturing
 realistic magnitudes of ad effects in online retail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these limitations, we believe the methodology of creating a simulated
 online store holds promise.
 As our results show, it is possible to create a store where consumers make
 realistic search and purchase decisions and respond to ads.
 We have also demonstrated that one can conduct a large-scale lab experiment
 with thousands of participants by choosing a product that can be delivered
 online.
 Researchers can apply this methodology to other marketing problems, not
 necessarily related to ad content effects.
 Having created a simulated store, researchers can freely manipulate how
 the store presents information about products.
 Through such experiments, researchers could study how online retailers
 and platforms ought to optimally design the information environment in
 which consumers conduct their search.
 We would be excited to see future work in this area.

Proof of Proposition 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effective utility of consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 for the advertised book 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{A}=\min(u_{ik},z_{s,ik}^{A})$
\end_inset

 under the plain ad and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{G}=\min(u_{ik},z_{s,ik}^{G})$
\end_inset

 under the genre ad, where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{G}$
\end_inset

 are the search values.
 Under the plain ad, consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with taste profile 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 expects 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{ik}$
\end_inset

 to be distributed with CDF 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})=Pr(-\alpha_{i}p_{k}+\gamma_{i}g_{j}+\varepsilon_{ik}<u)$
\end_inset

, whereas under the genre ad this CDF is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{G}(u|g_{j}=1;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})=Pr(-\alpha_{i}p+\gamma_{i}+\varepsilon_{ik}<u)$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}>0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{G}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})<F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

, so the distribution of utilities under the genre ad first-order stochastically
 dominates that under the plain ad.
 Thus, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{G}>z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 for any price sensitivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},$
\end_inset

 and therefore the probabilities that consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 searches and purchases book 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 both increase.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 then similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{G}(u|p;\gamma_{i})>F_{u}^{A}(u;\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{G}<z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 for any price sensitivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, so the search and purchase probabilities for book 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 decrease.
 Finally, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{G}=w_{ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

 and the search and purchase probabilities of the consumer do not change.
 Combining these results, we get that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\bar{f}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Using the same arguments as in Proposition 2, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{A}=\min(u_{ik},z_{s,ik}^{A})$
\end_inset

 under the plain ad and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ik}^{P}=\min(u_{ik},z_{s,ik}^{P})$
\end_inset

 under the price ad.
 The consumer expects the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{ik}$
\end_inset

 to be distributed with CDF 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})=Pr(-\alpha_{i}p_{j}+\gamma_{i}g_{j}+\varepsilon_{ik}<u)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{P}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})=Pr(-\alpha_{i}p+\gamma_{i}g_{j}+\varepsilon_{ik}<u|p=p_{j})$
\end_inset

 under the price ad.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}=p^{max}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{u}^{P}(u|p;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})>F_{u}^{A}(u;\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 so the utility distribution under the plain ad stochastically dominates
 that under the price ad.
 This implies 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{s,ik}^{P}<z_{s,ik}^{A}$
\end_inset

, which leads to a lower probability of searching and purchasing book 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for any taste profile 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{i},\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 In turn, if

\begin_layout Standard
We create a bookstore using open-source website development software, WordPress,
 which is commonly used for creating e-commerce stores.
 We augment the standard functionality of WordPress with a plug-in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WooCommerce
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that allows us to create a realistic storefront, customize the store layout,
 populate the store with a custom assortment of books (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

), and create a checkout page.
 To randomize ad exposures, we also use plug-ins that enable us to personalize
 the store layout for each website visitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, by connecting our WordPress account to Google Analytics, we collect
 anonymized individual-level data that capture everything website visitors
 see and do when browsing our bookstore.
 The default Google Analytics software tracks basic events like clicks and
 add-to-cart events, logging them with corresponding time stamps.
 We augment these data by creating custom event tags that document consumer
 search at a more granular level.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To further improve this methodology, researchers can employ state of the
 art tracking tools such as screen recordings and heat maps offered in commercia
l analytics software (e.g., Hotjar, Mouseflow, or Contentsquare).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 With these custom tags, we track how far down a person scrolls in the product
 list; the number of product list pages they open; whether they use filters,
 sorting tools, or search queries; whether they click on the advertising
 banner; and even whether they open several tabs in their browser while
 comparing books.
 We also observe the order in which books are presented to each user in
 the default sort, on product list pages after applying filters or using
 search queries, and in recommendation panels.
 To verify the quality of collected data, we browse the store according
 to a pre-determined script and verify that the resulting dataset accurately
 reflects the scripted browsing activity (see the Online Supplement for
 details).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We populate our bookstore with an assortment of 100 strategically selected
 books.
 We describe our book selection criteria below.
 Our store should offer a reasonably large assortment of differentiated
 options to create a meaningful search problem.
 To this end, we include books from five different genres: biography/memoir,
 fantasy, mystery/thriller, romance, and science fiction.
 By including books of different genres, we make sure the store offers appealing
 options for users with heterogeneous preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also want to select high-quality books to interest users in making a
 purchase and keeping the book after the study.
 However, we do not want any particular book to dominate other options.
 To achieve this balance, we scrape genre-specific bestseller lists from
 Amazon and construct a list of the 300 most popular books within each genre.
 For each genre, we then discard the top 50 and select 20 books that are
 currently sold at a price below $3, which helps us reduce the expected
 cost of the experiment.
 Choosing inexpensive books also reduces the dispersion of prices in the
 store, thus making it more likely that no single book dominates other options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We set the books' prices equal to the current Amazon prices, which range
 between $0.99 and $2.99, except for the two advertised books that we sell
 at $0.99 instead of the original $2.99.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 explains how we choose the books to advertise and our reasons for changing
 their prices.
 The average price of books in our assortment is $2.09.
 Finally, in the default sorting of the product list, each page displays
 two books from each genre, ordering books within each genre by their Amazon
 sales rank.
 In our store, we keep prices and rankings fixed over time, even when the
 actual prices and sales ranks of these books change on Amazon.
 In the Online Supplement, we report the full list of 100 books in the assortmen
t along with their prices and rankings.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recruited participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
 In all studies, we used Cloud Research, a platform that facilitates the
 recruiting of MTurk workers for academic and industry research.
 First, to stress-test our experiment infrastructure, we ran a pilot experiment
 on February 1-3, 2022.
 This study was a simplified experiment with only 
\begin_inset Formula $N=692$
\end_inset

 participants and one advertising banner instead of six.
 Based on the results of this pilot experiment, we selected a compensation
 scheme that allows us to incentivize realistic choices while also minimizing
 the cost of the experiment (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:incentive_compatibility"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 Specifically, during the pilot experiment we randomly assigned all participants
 to four incentive conditions: 0% fulfillment (no one gets an e-book or
 a bonus), 10% lottery, 50% lottery, and 100% fulfillment (all participants
 receive an e-book and a bonus).
 We found that 50% is the lowest fulfillment probability that enables us
 to measure advertising effects similar to those in the fully incentivized
 100% fulfillment condition.
 Based on the results of this study, we fixed the lottery probability at
 50% in the main experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, between March 30, 2022, and April 23, 2022, we conducted a pre-test
 of our main experiment with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1,191$
\end_inset

 participants.
 The data from this pre-test were used to obtain preliminary estimates of
 advertising effects, which served as inputs into our power calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we pre-registered our main experiment on AsPredicted.org on May
 18, 2022, and we ran it between May 19, 2022, and August 3, 2022.
 Based on the pre-test data, we calculated that we would need at least 12,500
 participants to measure the effects of advertising exposure and content.
 Because our budget was fully determined by an external grant, we committed
 to running the study until we exhausted all available resources or ran
 out of participants to recruit on Amazon MTurk–whichever happened sooner
 (see the pre-registration document).
 In the end, we were able to collect survey responses from 
\begin_inset Formula $N=16,088$
\end_inset

 participants before we exhausted our budget, out of which 
\begin_inset Formula $N=11,498$

 participants (71.5%) had complete browsing and purchase data.

Participants were told that the study would investigate their preferences
 for e-books.
 We informed prospective participants that they would receive baseline compensat

 of up to $3.00.
 To ensure they did not know the true purpose of the study, we did not mention
 advertising in the recruitment materials.
 We informed all participants that they must complete the survey using a
 standard browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
 Our goal was to minimize the number of participants who use privacy-focused
 browsers, such as Brave and Avast, which actively block user-tracking software.
 Importantly, before the study, we did not explicitly mention anything about
 behavior tracking to participants, as we did not want to alert them to
 the fact that their browsing behavior would be monitored.
 We also contemplated asking participants to turn off their ad blockers
 but decided against it for fear of artificially drawing attention to advertisem
ents.

Randomization Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:two_randomizations"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment randomizes participants into seven advertising conditions
 that determine which advertising banner the participant sees on the front
 page of the bookstore.
 We ran the main experiment between May 19, 2022, and August 3, 2022.
 During the first part of the experiment, between May 19, 2022, and July
 5, 2022, we implemented randomization in the bookstore by using a paid
 plug-in called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A/B Testing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for WooCommerce.
 The plug-in served random advertisements to all website visitors, assigning
 each user to one of the seven experimental conditions according to the
 pre-specified probabilities.
 The plug-in tracked individual users over time with cookies so that users
 would not be re-randomized into another condition when they returned to
 the front page.
 While this randomization method worked well and passed all our quality
 tests (see the Online Supplement for details regarding these tests), we
 later realized that this method has a drawback.
 Specifically, because participants who used ad blockers or privacy browsers
 were not generating any search data, we could not observe which experimental
 conditions they were assigned to.
 Moreover, we suspected that ad blockers were more active at blocking Google
 Analytics in the treatment arms than in the control group.
 While this issue did not seem to affect our randomization checks, we confirmed
 this suspicion by browsing the website while using different ad blockers
 and checking the data gathered by Google Analytics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this issue of missing data, we paused the experiment on July
 5 and re-designed our randomization algorithm.
 In particular, we removed the A/B testing plug-in from the bookstore and
 instead performed randomization in the Qualtrics survey before sending
 participants to the bookstore.
 Operationally, this randomization system worked as follows.
 At the start of the Qualtrics survey, we assigned each participant to one
 of the seven experimental conditions according to the same pre-specified
 probabilities as before.
 We then gave each user a seven-digit code, e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1BG83WL,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which the first symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reflects the experimental assignment and the remaining text 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

BG83WL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a unique combination of alphanumeric symbols drawn without replacement.
 The user was then instructed to use their seven-digit code in the bookstore,
 both at the entry gate and at checkout.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because we randomly generated 7-digit alphanumeric codes, it was difficult
 for participants to cheat by guessing another valid unique code and buying
 another book.
 Even if they managed to do so, we would detect fraud because both book
 orders would be registered from the same IP address, which we would observe
 in the Google Analytics dataset.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If-So
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plug-in for WooCommerce, we then served users their assigned advertisements
 based on the first digit of the seven-digit code they used at the entry
 gate.
 The advantage of this new randomization algorithm was that we knew users'
 experimental assignments even when they used ad blockers and privacy browsers
 because users were randomized before they visited the store.
 We resumed the study with this new randomization and ran it between July
 13, 2022, and August 3, 2022.
 We recruited about 60% of our total sample of participants under the first
 randomization algorithm and the remaining 40% under the second algorithm.

As detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:incentive_compatibility"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we conducted a lottery in which each participant had a 50% chance of having
 their order fulfilled, which meant receiving their selected book as well
 as a monetary bonus.
 The easiest way to implement this incentive would be to recruit all participant
s, consolidate data on their book selections, and fulfill all orders at
 once.
 This timing was infeasible, however, because Amazon MTurk workers typically
 expect to receive their bonus compensation within a few days after taking
 the study.
 We could not, therefore, wait until the end of our three-month recruitment
 period.
 We solved this problem by fulfilling orders in one-week 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

waves.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Each week, we made a list of book selections made by the participants who
 took the study in the previous seven days.
 We then conducted a lottery, selected the winners, manually purchased the
 books on Amazon, and sent the personalized redemption links to participants
 via the Amazon Mechanical Turk API.
 We also sent participants their personalized bonuses at that time.
 To avoid being flagged by Amazon for suspicious activity, we purchased
 all books using an Amazon Business Account affiliated with our university.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Prior to using the business account, we tried using one of our individual
 Amazon accounts.
 The account was immediately blocked by Amazon's anti-fraud algorithm after
 we purchased more than 300 books.
 We caution researchers against using their individual accounts for purchasing
 large numbers of products without special authorization of the online retailer.
\end_layout

 When participants received redemption links, they were told that they would
 have two weeks to redeem their books.
 After two weeks, we logged which books were still unredeemed and returned
 any unclaimed books for a full refund from Amazon.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 attempt and ignored any subsequent attempts.
 We call an attempt successful if the person passed the comprehension checks,
 was assigned a unique code, and used this code at the entry gate of our
 bookstore.
 To verify the code usage, we searched in the Google Analytics data (search
 data) for a user that entered this unique code at the entry gate during
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appropriate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 time period, i.e., between the time when the survey attempt was started and
 finished according to Qualtrics.
 Given this selection rule, a person who took the survey once but did not
 pass comprehension checks was removed from the dataset.
 A person who failed comprehension checks the first time but then returned
 and passed them the second time was included in the dataset as long as
 they used their unique code in the bookstore on the second attempt.
 If the same person returned to the bookstore again, their third visit was
 excluded; in this case, we kept only their second visit in the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exception to this rule are the participants who answered all pre-shopping
 and post-shopping questions in Qualtrics, but whose codes were not recorded
 within the Google Analytics data.
 This scenario could occur if a person completed the entire study but used
 an ad blocker that prevented us from collecting their browsing data.

 the study by completely skipping the bookstore.
 Upon checkout, the store generates a password that the participant has
 to enter in Qualtrics in order to access the remaining questions and complete
 the study.
 Therefore, a participant who attempts to skip the bookstore would realize
 that they do not have the password they need to proceed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Because we have no way of matching these participants to their search data,
 we dropped these survey attempts from the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose this data matching and cleaning process to ensure that we only
 include data from search sessions in which participants were exposed to
 advertising for the first time.
 In the final dataset, we observe a cross-section of participants and the
 time periods during which these participants took their first

 Using the assigned unique checkout codes, we merge Qualtrics data from
 these participants with individual-level search data from Google Analytics.

After checkout, we gave each participant a password that corresponds to
 the book they purchased (e.g., password

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 for the book 
\shape italic
Stateline
\shape default
).
 We asked them to return to the Qualtrics survey and use the password to
 access additional questions.
 Thus, even if a participant did not generate any search data (e.g., due to
 a privacy-enhancing browser), we knew which book they purchased from the
 password they entered.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For each individual, we only retrieved search data for the appropriate
 period between the start and the end of the relevant survey attempt.
 Therefore, if a website user returned to our bookstore after the study
 trying to check out another book, their browsing activity after the experiment
 was dropped from the dataset.

To check whether randomization appears to have been implemented properly,
 we tested for equality of means using demographic variables and stated
 book preferences collected before the randomization occurred.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some participants were assigned to a treatment condition but either i) did
 not complete the check-out process, ii) did not return to the Qualtrics
 survey after checking out, or iii) used a privacy-preserving tool that
 prevents us from collecting their browsing data.
 While some attrition is expected, differential attrition across treatment
 groups could generate bias.
 We test for differential attrition using a sample of 
\begin_inset Formula $7,479$
\end_inset

 participants who took the study after July 13, 2022.
 As described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:two_randomizations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, on that date we switched to a different randomization procedure that recorded
 experimental assignments before participants visited the bookstore.
 Because we observe the treatment assignments of all participants, including
 those that were eventually excluded from the sample, we can conduct a formal
 attrition analysis.
 We unfortunately cannot perform the same test for participants recruited
 prior to July 13 because we do not always observe their treatment assignments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these data, we estimate the following regression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{Completed Survey}_{i}=\alpha+\sum_{j=1}^{6}\beta_{j}\cdot T_{i}^{j}+\varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the mean attrition rate in the no advertising condition and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

is an indicator that participant 
\emph on
i 
\emph default
is assigned to the advertising condition 
\emph on
j.
 
\emph default
The results are reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 None of the ad conditions have significantly different attrition rates
 from the control group at the 5% significance level.
 We also cannot reject the hypothesis that all six ad conditions have the
 same attrition probability as the no advertising condition (joint 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.64$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\emph{p}-value}=0.132$
\end_inset

).

Finally, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 reports a balance test, showing the averages of all pre-treatment covariates
 across the seven experimental conditions, as well as the 
\emph on

\emph default
-values of joint significance 
\emph on
F
\emph default
-tests.
 While there are some minor differences in the averages of pre-treatment
 covariates across groups, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal
 means for 23 out of 24 covariates.
 One exception is that participants assigned to the no-advertising group
 are about 7 months older than participants assigned to the advertising
 conditions.
 Although the difference is significant at the 10% level, the difference
 appears economically small.
 We also simultaneously tested the null hypothesis of equal means for all
 24 covariates by estimating a system of seemingly unrelated regressions
 (SUR), which generates a joint significance 
\emph on

Internal Validation: Does Our Experiment Elicit Realistic Behavior?

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal in this experiment was to create a store that would induce participants
 to make realistic book choices.
 To understand whether we achieved this goal, we present several validation
 analyses.
 First, we use experimental data to verify that consumers engage in meaningful
 search in our store and make choices consistent with their self-reported
 preferences.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_search"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and in the left panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_comscore"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, consumers engage in active search.
 Consumers spend, on average, 3.7 minutes when shopping in our bookstore.
 The average consumer opens 4.0 pages in the product list, which includes
 pages in the default-sorted list as well as any pages opened after applying
 filters, sorting books by price, or using search queries.
 There is substantial heterogeneity in how much consumers search: around
 35% of consumers only view the first page of the assortment, and at the
 other extreme, 15% of consumers open at least 10 pages.
 The average consumer also visits 3.3 product pages, including revisits,
 and searches 1.9 unique books.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the observed book choices align with participants' self-reported
 genre preferences.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation_genre_choice"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 plots the probability of purchasing a book of a specific genre as a function
 of which genre the consumer reported liking most.
 All five figures show that a consumer is about twice as likely to purchase
 a book in their most preferred genre than a book of any other genre offered
 in the store.
 For example, a consumer purchases a fantasy book with a 26% probability
 if their most preferred genre is fantasy and with only a 5-13% probability
 if they prefer some other genre.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:validation_purchases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 additionally describes the distribution of purchases across different subcatego
ries of books by genre and price.
 Reassuringly, we do not observe that consumers focus their purchases on
 a few books on the front page, which is what we would see if their only
 goal was to quickly finish the study and get their cash bonus.
 In fact, all 100 books in the assortment are purchased at least once (column
 3), and the purchases are not overly concentrated on one popular book,
 even within each subcategory (columns 5-9).
 Within most genre subcategories, consumers are more likely to buy inexpensive
 books that cost under $1.00; however, some consumers do purchase more expensive
 books.
 Our incentive-compatible experiment design has therefore made consumers
 price sensitive, but not overly so because we do not see them always choosing
 the most inexpensive books to maximize the cash bonus.
 Based on these results, we conclude that our experiment design has elicited
 meaningful search behavior and has induced consumers to make realistic
 choices that align with their book preferences.

External Validation: Search Behavior of Actual Amazon Consumers 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:external_validation"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now compare our data to an external dataset that tracks the search behavior
 of real consumers in the category of books on Amazon.
 We analyze the Comscore Web-Behavior Panel 2019-2020, which includes approximat
ely 2 million U.S.
 households.
 Households install software on their computers that tracks their online
 browsing activity on all websites and logs their online transactions.
 These data enable us to identify all instances in which a household visited
 a product page on Amazon–not necessarily for a book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then classify all product page visits into product categories using a
 dataset of Amazon products obtained from a third-party service, Keepa,
 that repeatedly tracks product pages on Amazon.
 Using these additional data, we restrict the dataset to product pages of
 books, and we identify all books that fall into the same five categories
 that are represented in our store: biography/memoir, fantasy, mystery/thriller,
 romance, and science fiction.
 Given that we populated the store using books sold on Amazon, the definitions
 of book genres in our dataset are fully consistent with the genre categories
 we observe in the Keepa dataset.

Having defined relevant product page visits, we restrict the sample to household
s that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

searched
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (i.e., visited the product page of) at least one book from the five genres
 in question.
 We treat each day as a separate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

search session,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so a household that searched for books on three different days will appear
 in the data as three separate observations.
 These selection steps leave us with a sample of 171,429 households, with
 each household searching in 4.6 sessions on average.
 We combine the search data with users' online transactions, also obtained
 from Comscore, and we compare the extent to which the distribution of searches
 and purchases across genres matches our observations in our experiment.

 visualizes the number of unique books searched by each consumer in a typical
 search session, comparing the distribution in Comscore data (left panel)
 and in our experimental dataset (right panel).
 We find that the two distributions look almost identical.
 Consumers search little in both datasets: around 62% of consumers search
 only one book, 18% search two books, and less than 3% search ten books
 or more.
 The average number of searches is 2.19 in Comscore data, which is similar
 to the 1.93 in our sample.
 It is reassuring that consumers in our experiment search as much as Amazon
 customers, which supports the idea that our store elicits realistic search
 behavior.

As we explain in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

, we find strong evidence of

location
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 spillovers in our experiment.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:location_spillovers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we visualize the effects of advertising 
\shape italic
Lost Girls
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
Stateline
\shape default
 on the purchase rates of the 20 books located on the first two pages of
 the store.
 Each graph orders books by their ranking in the default list.
 As expected, advertising substantially increases the purchase rate of the
 advertised books, consistent with strong advertising effects in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ate_bothbooks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Interestingly, we also find that advertising lifts demand for books located
 close to the advertising banner.
 At the 10% significance level, advertisements for 
\shape italic
Lost Girls
\shape default
 increase demand for four books: 
\shape italic
Rhapsodic
\shape default
 (rank 2), 
\shape italic
A Ruin of Roses
\shape default
 (rank 3), 
\shape italic
Every Little Secret
\shape default
 (rank 5), and 
\shape italic
Rebound Love
\shape default
 (rank 8).
 At the same time, these ads reduce demand for 
\shape italic
Mrs.
 Kennedy and Me
\shape default
 (rank 1) and 
\shape italic
Dead by Sunset
\shape default
 (rank 6).
 We find virtually identical effects for the advertisements for 
\shape italic
Stateline
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these effects are not directly predicted by spatial search models,
 they are consistent with the following attention hypothesis.
 A salient advertising banner draws consumers' attention to itself while
 generating attention spillovers to other nearby books.
 Such attention spillovers would explain why advertising increases demand
 for books located directly under the advertising banner.
 An interesting puzzle in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:location_spillovers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is why advertising reduces the purchase rate of the books in the first
 and sixth positions.
 We speculate that, given the store layout, consumers naturally examine
 the assortment from top to bottom and from left to right, which generates
 position effects.
 The advertising banner may then disrupt the normal flow of search and weaken
 the position effects.
 Such an effect may explain why the two books in the leftmost column of
 the first page lose popularity.
 The excess demand is then re-distributed toward appealing books that are
 located closer to the banner.
 This phenomenon would explain why advertising increases demand for the
 book 
\shape italic
Every Little Secret
\shape default
, which has the highest purchase rate (12.6%) among books in our assortment.
 A promising direction for future research might be to further test this
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attention spillover
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hypothesis by randomizing the location of the ad banner.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One could randomize both the location of the ad banner in the store and
 the rankings of books, thus varying the location of the advertising banner
 relative to the organic listings of non-advertised books.
 Eye-tracking software may also help reveal whether the advertising banner
 changes how consumers visually examine books on store pages.
